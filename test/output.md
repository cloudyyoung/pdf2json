## Zadoks decimal growth stages   

## Feekes large growth stages   

## Cereal growth stages   

The Feekes and Zadoks scales define the growth stages of a relatively uniform cereal crop. Completion of these growth stages by the cereal crop will be influenced greatly by soil temperature, moisture, air temperature and day length. For example, stages 2 to 5 in the Feekes scale may take 5 to 6 weeks, whereas stages 6 to 10 may be completed in 2 to 3 weeks under prairie conditions.   

To establish the growth stage of a cereal crop using either of these scales, it is necessary to collect a random sample of plants to determine the level of growth attained by the majority of the plants.   

Under good growing conditions, examination of up to 10 randomly selected plants may be appropriate. Under conditions of uneven germination and low soil moisture, growth stage assessment may require larger samples.   

Application of an agrochemical must be timed precisely to maximize the desired effect on the target crop. All agrochemical applications (fungicides, growth regulators, herbicides or supplemental nutrients) must be based on physiological growth stage of the crop. Applications based on calendar  days are less accurate and will be less successful.

## How to use this resource   

This publication assists in the selection and application of pesticides. The pesticides are grouped into four main sections:   

• herbicides   

• insecticides   

• seed treatments   

• foliar fungicides   

Each section is indexed separately and contains selector charts located after the registration information.   

Use the pesticide selector charts and the detailed pesticide descriptions to choose the most  appropriate chemicals. To select a suitable  pesticide, follow these steps.   

• Identify the pest(s).   

• Refer to the chart for weeds, insect pests or diseases and record the pesticide(s) available.   

• Refer to the appropriate pesticide(s) in the text  and select the product best suited to your operation.   

• Apply the pesticide strictly according to instructions given on the label attached  to the product container.   

## Chemical pest control summary   

## Know your problem(s)   

• Identify the pest(s).   

• Estimate infestation level or probable economic loss to determine if treatment is required.   

• Know the crop variety. Some products are restricted to, or excluded from, use on specific  crop types or varieties.   

• If necessary, note soil type or texture of the area  to be treated.   

## If chemical control is necessary, choose a pesticide based on the following criteria   

• Registered products for the given crop  (tank mixes may have separate recommendations).   

• Pests controlled by the product.   

• Crop and pest stage of growth or development.   

• Recommended application time  (e.g., spring, summer, fall; time of day).   

• Cropping and/or harvest restrictions of product(s) considered.   

## Read product label directions for   

• Recommended rate(s) for the particular pest, infestation level, crop and field conditions.   

• Method of application.   

• Any application restrictions during adverse  or extreme weather conditions.   

• Any other restrictions, cautions or special instructions.   

## Clean, prepare, maintain application equipment   

• Lubricate and repair equipment to get the best possible performance.   

• Clean spray tank of residues to prevent crop damage or problems with equipment.   

• Clean, calibrate and, if necessary, replace  spray nozzles.   

• Check pump and pressure system.   

10   

back to Table of Contents   

## Safely prepare pesticides for application   

• Use protective clothing and recommended safety equipment; the exposure hazard is greatest  during mixing.   

• Follow the mixing instructions.   

• Use the specified amount and quality of water.   

• Use recommended rates (tank mix rates may be different from each pesticide used alone).   

• If specified, add adjuvants.   

• Record the following: rates used, mix order, pesticides and adjuvants. Also record water quality for future reference.   

## Apply pesticides using   

• Recommended safety precautions and equipment.   

• Proper application equipment.   

• Recommended rates of pesticides, adjuvants  and water.   

• Proper time (e.g., growth stage, time of day, season).   

• Recommended techniques (e.g., ground speed, pressure, incorporation).   

• Record weather conditions at time of application, techniques used, growth stage of crop and pests  for future reference.   

## Sprayer operations   

## Getting the sprayer ready   

• Preliminary maintenance, adjustments and settings must be made according to the operator’s manual.   

• The entire sprayer system should be cleaned  and rinsed.   

• Ensure all nozzles are the same size and spray angle by checking the code number on the nozzle tip.   

• Partially fill sprayer tank with clean water.   

• Check the pump for adequate output. If the desired spraying pressure can be achieved with the agitator and boom valves open, the pump output is okay.   

• Check accuracy of main sprayer gauge by installing a new gauge at a tip location on each boom section. Operate entire spray boom at normal pressure. Compare pressure at nozzle to main sprayer gauge. Note pressure difference and adjust sprayer pressure accordingly. Pressure drop is common and is more severe at higher flow rates.   

• Inspect spray patterns and replace tips that have streaky patterns. Flat fan nozzle alignment should be slightly offset, so the patterns do not interfere with each other.   

## Standard benchmarks

## Nozzle calibration   

There are several reasons why a nozzle may not produce its advertised nominal flow rate. These include plugging of the nozzle, nozzle screen or another component of the nozzle body, obstructed boom section or main screen, nozzle wear and physical damage. Confirming the actual flow rate of the nozzles is an important part of good spray practice.   

1. Ensure sprayer is clean and contains sufficient water for calibration.   

2. Install accurate pressure gauge on boom. A threaded nozzle cap will fit a standard gauge thread. The nozzle cap can then be installed in place of a nozzle.   

3. Operate all boom sections and set boom pressure to 40 psi.   

4. Collect spray from each nozzle for a consistent length of time. Depending on the capacity of the vessel, this may be, for example, 30 seconds.   

5. Measure and record volume from each nozzle.   

6. Calculate average flow rate per minute and compare to nominal flow for that size nozzle (see nozzle chart in this publication).   

7. If overall average flow rate is significantly greater than the nominal flow for that nozzle, the set is worn and should be replaced.   

8. If flow deviation is associated with a boom section, confirm spray pressure at that section and correct any flow obstructions.   

9. If average flow rate is within specifications, identify individual nozzles whose output deviates by more than 5% from the average. Correct by cleaning or replacing.   

Nozzle calibration tools are available from certain suppliers. These calculate flow rate electronically, and may store the flow values for analysis.   

Nozzle calibration cannot be done with the sprayer’s flow meter or by measuring tank contents. Such approaches measure total flow and will not detect problems with individual nozzles or boom sections.   

## Nozzle sizing (conventional systems)   

All sprayer nozzles come in standardized (ISO) sizes, and these sizes are usually identified by numbers stamped on the nozzle as well as the colour of the nozzle itself. The colours and flow numbers are shown in the nozzle chart on page 646.   

For field sprayers, the fan angle has a value between 65 and 150, with 80 and 110 being most common. For any given nozzle, wider fan angles produce finer sprays and allow lower boom heights. Flow rate units on all nozzles are US gallons of water per minute (gpm) at 40 psi. An 04 nozzle will be red in colour and deliver 0.4 gpm at 40 psi.   

Application volume (i.e., gallons per acre or litres per hectare) is a function of travel speed, nozzle spacing along the boom and nozzle flow rate. The following formulae identify this relationship:   

US units: speed (mph)=(nozzle flow rate (gpm) x 5940) (application volume (gpa) x nozzle spacing (inch))   

For example, a sprayer exhibits an average nozzle flow of  0.5 gpm, the nozzle spacing is 20” and the intended application volume is 10 gpa.   

speed (mph)=(0.4 x 5940)                        (10 x 20)   

speed=11.9 mph   

   

Metric units: speed (km/h)=(nozzle flow rate (L/min) x 600) (application volume (L/ha) x nozzle spacing (m)   

For example, a sprayers exhibits an average nozzle flow of  1.6 L/min, the nozzle spacing is 50 cm and the intended application volume is 120 L/ha.   

speed (km/h)=(1.6 x 600)                         (120 x 0.5)   

speed=16 km/h   

   

The nozzle chart assumes the common 20” spacing and can be used to select the proper nozzle size. Along the left side are nozzle sizes and pressures (psi). Along the top is application volume (gpa or  L/acre). The body of the table contains travel speed (mph).   

12   

back to Table of Contents   

1. Select the column that contains your application volume.   

2. Move down the column until you encounter your target speed.   

3. At the target speed, move to the left within that row to arrive at the spray pressure and nozzle size that produced the result.   

4. If the spray pressure is above your nozzles’ pressure range, continue down the column until your travel speed is encountered again. This solution will be for a larger nozzle size and a lower spray pressure.   

5. Continue this process until the suitable pressure solution if found.   

6. Once a nozzle size is selected, the possible travel speeds within its pressure range are shown in the original column.   

It is important to know the pressure range of the nozzle model. Select a spray pressure that falls near the middle of this range in order to allow for travel speed flexibility.   

If the installed nozzle is larger or smaller than the size resulting from this process, adjust water volume or travel speed to compensate. Do not operate the nozzle outside of its recommended pressure range.   

## Nozzle sizing (pulse width modulated (PWM) systems)   

PWM uses a pulsing solenoid at the nozzle body to briefly interrupt the liquid flow to the nozzle. PWM systems should be operated at about 60 to 80% duty cycle on average to optimize features such as turn compensation and travel speed range.   

In PWM systems, flow rate changes from different travel speeds are managed by duty cycle, not spray pressure. This allows the operator to select a spray pressure that produces the desired spray quality. This pressure does not change throughout the system’s travel speed range.   

The same chart can be used to size for PWM systems by adding 20 to 40% water volume to the desired solution. If wanting to apply 10 gpa, select a nozzle that delivers between 12 and 14 gpa. The duty cycle will automatically be reduced from 100% (wide open) to between 60 and 80% in order to produce the 10 gpa flow rate.   

## Calculating required product amounts   

Step 1: Determine the number of acres to be sprayed.   

Example:   

160 acres   

Step 2: Know the sprayer tank capacity, which is marked on sprayer tank.   

Example:   

1,200 gal (4,500 L)   

Step 3: Determine spray volume needed per acre, which can be obtained by consulting the pesticide label or this publication.   

Example:   

10 gpa (40 L/acre)   

Step 4: Calculate total spray solution needed by multiplying number of acres x litres per acre.   

Example:   

160 acres x 40 L/acre = 6,400 L 160 acres x 10 gpa= 1,600 gal   

Some product will remain in the sprayer’s plumbing system after it is pumped empty. This volume needs to be added to the calculated amount. It is advisable to monitor the amount of spray remaining in the tank throughout the spray operation to ensure the sprayer’s flow meter operates properly and the intended application rate is achieved. The application rate can be adjusted slightly during the operation to minimize leftover spray mix.   

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of pesticide needed by consulting the pesticide label or this publication (multiply litres of pesticide per acre x number of acres to spray).   

Example 1:   

0.6 L/acre  0.6 L/acre x 160 acres = 96 L of product   

Example 2:   

30 acres/case 100 acres x 30 acres/case = 5.3 cases   

Step 6: For maximum efficiency, determine the number of tanks needed and the pesticide load required. For example, the product may be packaged so that 1 case is sufficient to treat 30 acres, and the field requires 5.3 cases. Dividing the loads accordingly, the last would require a partial case.   

Example:   

Load 1 – 3 cases * 30 acres/case = 90 acres  90 acres * 10 gpa = 900 gal   

   

   

Load 2 – 70 acres remaining 70 acres / 30 acres/case = 2.3 cases  70 acres * 10 gpa = 700 gal

## Calibrating small sprayers   

The spray volume a backpack or hand-held sprayer will apply per acre can be determined by field testing the sprayer on a portion of an acre. The size  of the test area commonly used is 1/100 of an acre.  It is important that the test area surface is similar to the surface to be sprayed, so the walking speed will remain the same.   

Step 1: Establish a test run distance to spray  1/100 acre (40.5 m2) according to the swath width  of the sprayer.   

## Swath width   

## Test run length   

0.5 metres   

81 metres  1 metres   

40.5 metres  1.5 metres   

27 metres  2 metres   

20.2 metres   

Step 2: At a comfortable walking speed, spray the test area and measure the volume of water used (repeat 2 or 3 times to obtain an average).  This is the amount applied to 1/100 acre.   

Example:   

2 litres   

Step 3: Multiply the figure arrived at in Step 2  by 100 to get the spray volume per acre.   

Example:   

2 L x 100 = 200 L/acre   

Step 4: Determine the amount of pesticide to add per tank load. Divide the volume applied per acre  by tank capacity to determine the number of fills required to spray an acre.   

Example:   

200 L/acre ÷ 20 L/tank = 10 fills   

Divide the chemical rate per acre by the number of tank loads required to spray an acre to determine  the amount of product to add per tank load.   

Example:   

1 L/acre ÷ 10 fills = 0.1 L/tank   

## Preparation and application   

## of pesticides   

## Tank mixtures   

Tank mixtures are comprised of 2 or more pesticides that are combined in the sprayer tank, as opposed to a mixture formulated by the manufacturer.  Tank mixing is often done to reduce the number of applications of pesticide. A grassy herbicide in combination with a broadleaf herbicide is one of the most common mixtures. Another reason to mix herbicides is to include multiple modes of action to combat the development of resistance in the target pest.   

## Preparing a tank mix   

To avoid physical incompatibilities, go through the following general steps or use the appropriate mixing instructions below:   

• Add half the required amount of water and mix with one pesticide.   

• Agitate.   

•   

With agitator running, add the other pesticide. Add pesticides to the spray tank in the following order to reduce the possibility of formation of precipitates or gums that may clog nozzles and filters.

– soluble powders   

   

– wettable powders and flowable liquids   

   

– solutions (amines and salts)   

   

– emulsifiable concentrates (esters)   

   

– additives (surfactants)   

## Water quality   

The term “water quality” refers to its cleanliness and chemical composition and can be critical to the performance of pesticides. Ensuring good performance requires testing water and understanding the results.   

There are 4 main water quality indicators related to pesticide performance.   

1. Water hardnessWater hardness is caused by positively charged minerals, primarily calcium (Ca++) and magnesium (Mg++), but also sodium (Na+) and iron (Fe++). These cations can bind to some herbicides (glyphosate is the best-known example, also 2,4-D amine), reducing their performance. Hardness is usually named “total hardness (calculated),” and is expressed in ppm or mg/L of calcium carbonate (CaCO3   

) equivalent. Some tests refer to the older unit “grains,” which is ppm divided by 17. Bayer suggests that total water hardness should be below 350 ppm (20 grains) for the low rate (1/2 L/acre equivalent) of glyphosate and below 700 ppm for the higher rates.   

2. Bicarbonate Sometimes referred to as alkalinity, the bicarbonate ion (HCO   

-3   

) can inhibit herbicide activity and also make some herbicides more difficult to mix. The most commonly affected herbicides are members of the Group 1 modes of action, products such as clethodim, sethoxydim and others, as well as MCPA amine and 2,4-D amine. The antagonistic effect of the bicarbonate ion depends on the presence of other ions such as sodium and calcium.   

3. pH This is a complex parameter because it is related to pesticide solubility, hard water antagonism and pesticide degradation. In most cases, pH values between 4 and 7 are considered acceptable. But some herbicides, notably those in the Group 2 modes of action, have specific pH needs to dissolve properly. For example, all Group 2 herbicides except for the imidazolinones dissolve better at higher pH,   

and this property has implications for both mixing and cleaning.   

4. Cleanliness / turbidity Water may contain suspended solids such as clay. Glyphosate and diquat (Reglone) are sensitive to this, as these chemicals are readily adsorbed to soil particles and turbid water can reduce their effectiveness. This is also why dust generated by the sprayer can reduce the performance of these herbicides.   

   

Select clean water sources and conduct a water test to identify possible problems. Use a conductivity meter to test the electrical conductivity (EC) of the spray water. Although this test will not identify the ions present, it will indicate the existence of a potential problem. EC values less than 500 µS/cm are considered safe. For values above 500, a hardness test is necessary to confirm the presence of antagonizing cations.   

If the water is hard, a generally accepted solution is to add ammonium sulphate (AMS) fertilizer at rates between 1 and 3% w/v of 21-0-0-24 to the spray tank, preferably before adding the herbicide. Spray grade liquid concentrate AMS product is available from some suppliers. The sulphate anions tie up the hard water cations, preventing them from antagonizing the herbicide. Liquid urea-ammonium nitrate (28-0-0) has also been shown to help with hard water, although it is not as effective as AMS.   

Caution is advised when adding foliar fertilizer specialty products to pesticide mixtures. Adding a blend of fertilizer salts, combined with associated changes in pH, can result in unpredictable interactions with pesticides and water. Ask for compatibility data and always conduct a jar test to be sure that the planned mixture does not result in a precipitate that can plug spray nozzles or make the pesticide inactive.   

Turbidity is a problem with surface waters, especially in areas of clay soils and after surface runoff. If spray water is taken from a pond, its turbidity can be reduced by adding aluminum sulphate at rates between 10 and 60 mg/L of pond water. Thorough agitation is required, and 80 to 95% removal of turbidity is achieved within 24 to 48 hours.

## Specific mixing instructions   

Ensuring the compatibility of various products in a tank mix requires following manufacturer directions on the product label. The following are the 5 most common instructions found on product labels and are referenced in the specific product sections in this book.   

The general principles of product mixing order are sometimes summarized using acronyms that can be followed when specific instructions are absent. The most common is WALES, where   

W is wettable powders   

A is agitate   

L is liquid flowables   

E is emulsifiable concentrates   

S is solutions   

There are exceptions to these rules. If in doubt, conduct a jar test using the actual water source. Water quality can affect mixing, with water that is hard, high in bicarbonates or cold sometimes causing issues. Excessive agitation should also be avoided.   

“a”   

## Single product mixing instructions   

   

1. Fill clean tank to ½ full with clean water.   

   

2. Turn on full agitation.   

   

3. Add the proper amount of herbicide to the water in the spray tank with the agitator running. Maintain full agitation until completely dissolved and product is fully dispersed. Continuous agitation  is required to keep the product in suspension.   

   

4. After herbicide has been well mixed and is  in suspension, add tank mix partners and then a recommended non-ionic surfactant, if required.   

   

5. Add the remainder of the water.   

On repeat tank loads, ensure that the amount of spray solution left in the tank from the previous load is less than 10% of the volume to be mixed.   

## “b” Multiple products mixing instructions   

   

1. Fill tank ½ full of water.   

   

2. Start sprayer agitation.   

   

3. Add Group 2 herbicide and agitate vigorously;  if a granule, agitate until dissolved.   

   

4. Add tank mix partner herbicide and continue  to agitate.   

   

5. Add adjuvant (if required) and continue to agitate.   

   

6. Add antifoaming agent if required and continue agitation.   

   

7. Complete filling of the tank with the balance  of the water.   

   

8. If tank mix partner is an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), to avoid inducing an invert emulsion, do not over agitate.   

## “c” Multiple products mixing instructions   

   

1. Clean spray tank and half fill with clean water. Start agitation or bypass system.   

   

2. Add broadleaf herbicide to the tank first, prior  to adding grassy herbicide, and agitate for  2 to 3 minutes.   

   

3. Add correct amount of grassy herbicide.   

   

4. Agitate for 2 to 3 minutes.   

   

5. Add correct amount of adjuvant (if required).   

   

6. Agitate for 1 to 2 minutes before adding remainder of water.   

   

7. After any break in spraying operations, agitate thoroughly before spraying again.   

   

8. Use the spray suspension as soon as it is prepared.   

   

9. If an oil film starts to build up in the tank,  drain tank and then clean with a detergent.   

## “d” Multiple products mixing instructions   

   

1. Ensure the spray tank is thoroughly clean.   

   

2. Fill the tank ½ to   

¾   

full with clean water and  start agitation or bypass system.   

   

3. Add grassy herbicide first. Vigorously agitate until dissolved.   

   

4. Add broadleaf herbicide product second followed by any registered tank mix partner (if desired).   

   

5. Add adjuvant/surfactant(if required) and complete filling the spray tank.   

## “e” Multiple products mixing instructions   

   

1. Always start with a clean and empty  sprayer tank.   

   

2. Fill the tank 1/3 to 1/2 full of clean water.   

   

3. With the agitator running, add the required amount of Express herbicide.   

   

4. When Express herbicide has been thoroughly dissolved, add the required amount of the appropriate tank mix partner.   

16   

back to Table of Contents   

   

5. If the tank mix partner is an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), reduce agitation to avoid inducing an invert emulsion. Once dissolved, Express will remain in solution.   

   

6. Add the rest of the water.   

   

7. If required for tank mixture, add surfactant.   

   

8. Refer to the label for specific tank mixing order and directions.   

   

9. For repeat tank loads, reduce the material remaining in the tank to 10% of the original volume or less before proceeding with Step 1 because remaining chemicals may prevent Express from completely dissolving. If it is  not possible, pre-slurry Express herbicide in  a small amount (5 to 10 L) of water before adding to the tank.   

10. If an anti-foaming agent is required, add last.   

## Avoid tank mix problems   

When tank mixing, product labels should be consulted to determine proper usage as per specific crops and pests. When tank mixing, some products may have restricted uses as compared to the recommendations for each individual product. For example, either Poast or MCPA Amine alone can be used on several crops.  A Poast + MCPA Amine tank mix can only be used  on flax.   

Crop injury, reduced pest control or physical incompatibilities may be the result of using tank mixes improperly. When herbicides for grassy weed control are mixed with herbicides for broadleaf weed control, a partial loss (sometimes total loss) of activity on grassy weed control is quite common. When reduced weed control or crop injury is likely to  occur, the advantages of tank mixing are quickly lost.   

• Tank mix properties are not necessarily the same as those of the individual pesticides applied separately.   

• Use registered tank mixes only.   

• Check the labels for recommended crops, pests, rates and adjuvants for tank mixing.   

• Follow label directions for preparing the mix.   

• Use only on crops or varieties registered for the particular tank mix.   

• Apply at the recommended stage of growth or development of crop and pest(s).   

## Sprayer clean-out and waste disposal   

Labels differ on their cleanout requirements. When in doubt, use the following general procedure.   

1.   

Carefully measure the volume requirements of the last tank before a change of products is planned. Accurate filling will help minimize leftovers.   

2.   

When a field has been sprayed, dispose of the tank remainders by spraying them out in the field or another designated site. Do not drain tank contents on the ground.   

3.   

Use a clean water tank to introduce clean water into the sprayer tank via wash-down nozzles. Multiple batches of smaller volumes are more efficient at diluting remainders than a single larger volume. Run solution pump long enough to ensure that all plumbing, including agitation and sparge, has been exposed to clean water. Spray this volume out in the field until the tank is empty. When spraying out, make sure to rinse through any bypass valves. Repeat at least 2 more times. See Table 1 to evaluate efficiency of diluting spray mix remainders. Note the effect of smaller remainder volumes and more batches of smaller volumes on overall remainder dilution.   

4.   

Some products specify the use of ammonia, surfactant or specific commercial products during cleanout.   

a. Ammonia acts to raise solution pH, which aids in cleaning products whose solubility improves with higher pH. These include all Group 2 products except those in the imidazolinone group. See “Herbicide group classification by mode of action” section for specific product names.   

b. Surfactants help solubilize oily products  such as EC formulations. Oily layers may trap Group 2 products to which canola can be very sensitive.   

c. Commercial products contain proprietary components that aid in cleaning pesticide products from sprayer components.   

5.   

Cleaning products should not be expected to degrade or neutralize pesticide residues. The cleaning process is all about effective dilution and removal of residues.   

17   

17   

back to Table of Contents   

6.   

Once dilution of the tank remainder is complete, rinse out boom ends and any other plumping components that were not open during dilution. Inspect and clean filters.   

7.   

Consider modifications to your sprayer to improve cleaning performance. A continuous rinse system uses a second pump to rinse the tank while it is simultaneously sprayed empty. A recirculating boom allows the boom to be primed or flushed without spraying product. Leftover pesticide rinsate can be disposed of using a biobed. Details on all these approaches are available at sprayers101.com.   

8.   

Sprayers should be cleaned as soon as possible after use. Dried pesticide residues are much more difficult to remove than pesticide in solution.   

9.   

Do not clean sprayers near creeks, dugouts, sloughs, wells or any other water sources. Ensure that wash water does not come into contact with any desirable vegetation or its roots. Make sure discharged wash water (especially from insecticides) will not be accessible to children or animals. Do not contaminate any watercourse or water body with wash water.   

10. Note: Pesticides may have specific recommendations for sprayer clean-out. Refer to product labels on the container for recommendations.

There are 3 main methods for sprayer tank clean-out. Selection of the appropriate method depends on the pesticide used.   

## Method A   

Drain contents of tank followed by 1 or 2 water rinses, 2 ammonia rinses (NOT containing chlorine) followed by 2 water rinses (one just prior to next sprayer event). Products that require this cleanup method include 2,4-D, Accent, Ally, Atrazine, Avadex, dicamba, dichlorprop + 2,4-D, Escort, Everest, Express, MCPA, Muster, Valtera, Poast Ultra, Prism, Pursuit, Refine, Refine M, Rustler and Tordon 22K.   

## Method B   

Drain contents of tank followed by 2 water rinses, 2 detergent rinses, then 2 more water rinses. Products that require this method include Axial, Liquid Achieve SC*, Achieve Liquid Gold*, Basagran, Bromoxynil + MCPA, clethodim, Liberty, Puma, Reglone Dessicant*, Reward*, Sencor and trifluralin products.   

* Manufacturers of these products recommend adding a non-ionic surfactant such as All Clear, Agral 90 or Agsurf at 0.6 L per 100 L water.   

## Method C   

Drain contents of tank followed by several repetitions of the water rinse with nozzles and screens removed and checked for debris.   

## Table 1   

18   

back to Table of Contents   

Products that require this method are Amitrol 240, Assure II, Attain, Dual II Magnum, Eclipse, glyphosate products, Horizon, Lontrel, Odyssey, Prestige and Solo.   

Always follow the instructions on the product label. Use the following guidelines if label recommendations don’t cover tank cleanup.   

Products that are water based can usually be  cleaned from the spray tank using Method C. Products formulated as an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), soluble concentrate (SC) or flowable (F) or use a petroleum-based adjuvant should at least use Method B. The detergent breaks down the oil that may be sticking to the sides of the tank. Most Group 2 herbicides have tank clean-out recommendations, but those that do not should use Method A for tank clean-out. If the tank mix is composed of multiple pesticides, use the appropriate combination of methods to clean the tank.   

Group 2 herbicides will occasionally get trapped on the tank wall by petroleum-based formulations or adjuvants, resulting in tank residues. Add detergent  at 0.25 L/100 L to the ammonia rinse to prevent this situation from happening. The detergent breaks down the petroleum coating to allow the ammonia access  to the Group 2 product.   

## What to do if results are unsatisfactory   

• Determine whether or not the pesticide(s) used were suitable.   Are the treated crops and pests listed on the product label(s)?   

• Compare your method of pesticide preparation  to the product label(s) instructions.   

• Check for equipment malfunction: for example, plugged screens, nozzles worn or mixed type or size.   

• Compare your application techniques with those given on label(s): for example, stage of growth or development of crop and pest(s), ground speed, pressure and incorporation.   

• Consider weather conditions at application time. Certain labels include cautions against application during weather extremes: for example, cold, heat and drought.   

• Consider time since application. Some results are not apparent for several days. Look for early symptoms of the chemical taking effect.   

• If results are unsatisfactory, seek technical help. Gather all relevant data, particularly evidence such as photos or specimens. Record wind, rainfall, soil moisture condition, crop variety, fertility, quantity of material used, acres treated and temperature at time of spraying.   

• Document everything in writing. If crop damage is involved, submit a specimen for diagnosis. Disease or insect damage can resemble herbicide injury.   

## The problem   

Agricultural pests can develop resistance to fungicides, herbicides or insecticides. Resistance occurs when a random and naturally occurring genetic mutation allows a low number of pests to survive a pesticide application. In the absence of other pest management strategies, these individuals grow and reproduce, resulting in an increase in the number of resistant individuals in the pest population. Farmers should follow agronomic practices that both mitigate the   

development of pesticide resistant pest populations and manage the spread of existing resistant populations.   

Since the first documented case of chickweed resistance in Alberta in 1988, the numbers of herbicide resistant weeds, fungicide resistant pathogens and insecticide resistant insects have increased and the area infested by them continues to grow. Potato blights have developed resistance to common fungicides,   

## Pesticide resistance   

19   

19   

back to Table of Contents   

insects have developed resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis (BT), a common biopesticide, and 26 weed biotypes have developed resistance to herbicides. At present in Alberta, weed biotypes are resistant to herbicides from 6 herbicide groups (modes of action). In addition, some pests (including weeds) are resistant to multiple pesticide groups (see table below). It is essential that farmers be able to identify these resistant pests and take action to mitigate and manage the development of resistance on their farms.   

## How to identify herbicide resistance   

Investigate all areas of the sprayed field where weed control was inadequate. Rule out other factors that might have affected herbicide performance including mis-application, spray misses, unfavourable weather conditions, herbicide application at an improper growth stage and weed flushes after application of non-residual herbicides. If resistance remains a likely possibility, check for the following.   

• Are other weeds listed on the product label controlled satisfactorily?   

• Is herbicide failure patchy with no reasonable explanation?   

• Did the same herbicide or herbicide group fail in this area of the field in the previous year?   

• Do weeds show herbicide injury symptoms such  as root pruning by a Group 3 herbicide or yellow/purple coloration caused by Group 2 applications. Resistant weed biotypes will not show these typical injury symptoms.   

• Do field histories indicate extensive use of the same herbicide (or herbicide group) year after year?   

   

The following webinar explains how to scout for herbicide-resistant weeds and which weeds to look out for in Alberta: www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yJnquucDRw&feature=youtube.   

## How to minimize the development  of resistance   

Follow the guidelines below to delay the appearance of resistance.   

•   

Integrated weed management practices: Use herbicides as part of an integrated control program that includes scouting, historical information related to herbicide use and crop rotation, and consider mechanical, cultural, biological and other control practices, including harvest weed seed control.   

•   

Herbicide and crop rotations:  Effective herbicide modes of action (groups) must be rotated. It is important not only to use a different herbicide, but to use one from a different herbicide group with a different mode of action that is effective on the weeds present in the field.   

•   

Field history: Records are needed to make sensible decisions on herbicide rotation and to evaluate the probability of resistance developing. A pesticide application record sheet can be found at the back of this book.   

•   

Tank mixture: A tank mix may delay the appearance of resistant weeds if the components  of the tank mixture effectively control the same weed and are from more than one mode of action. Be sure to check effective rates, and known resistant biotypes when designing a tank mix. When products are advertised as multiple modes of action be sure to check what herbicide modes of action are included. One of them may be a herbicide group to which resistance occurs already.   

•   

Monitor results: Monitor treated weed populations for resistance development. Scouting is necessary both before and after herbicide application to monitor application needs and herbicide efficacy.   

•   

Preventive measures: Prevent the movement of resistant weed seeds to other fields by cleaning harvest and tillage equipment as well as planting clean seed.

All kochia populations in Western Canada are considered Group 2 herbicide-resistant. It is safe to assume this without herbicide resistance testing (for this biotype only).   

Screening of suspected herbicide-resistant weed biotypes known to exist in Alberta can be performed by the Saskatchewan Crop Protection Lab (306-787-8130) for a fee, ranging from $125 to $200 per sample. Other diagnostic labs include Ag-Quest (204-776-2087) or the Manitoba Pest Surveillance Initiative (204-813-2171). The following webinar explains how to sample weeds with suspected herbicide resistance and submit them to a diagnostic lab:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRYODrUAbI4.   

Suspected cases of novel herbicide resistance, or herbicide-resistant weed biotypes not known to exist in Alberta, can be submitted to the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Prairie Herbicide Resistance Research Lab for herbicide resistance testing free of charge.

## Spray drift management   

## 1. Pesticide user responsibility   

Pesticide drift is a concern for ground as well as aerial application. Landowners are responsible for ensuring that any pesticide applications conducted on their property are conducted in a safe, responsible manner.   

The choice of chemical should be made with adjacent land uses in mind. If neighbours have livestock, bees, shelterbelts and gardens that may be affected by off-target drift, they should be notified prior to application. Perhaps a different chemical, formulation or application method will provide the same control and greater compatibility with neighbouring land uses.   

Always assess the risk to adjacent landowners and never push weather conditions to meet deadlines. If completing an application as planned may mean damaging your neighbour’s property, postpone the application or modify it to prevent off-target damage.   

Landowners can be held liable for pesticide drift even if a custom applicator was hired to perform the application. When hiring a custom applicator the company should be registered, employ certified professionals and possess the knowledge, equipment and expertise to perform the work properly. Custom applicators must be aware of neighbouring residences and sensitive crops (including gardens, livestock, bees, shelterbelts and gardens) that could present problems if drift should occur.   

All pesticide users, commercial pesticide applicators and farmers are legally responsible for safe pesticide use. Farmers who cause damage with their pesticide application activities or who counsel a commercial pesticide service to conduct either an illegal pesticide application or an application under questionable circumstances (e.g., extremely windy conditions) that results in damage, can be held liable for compensation and face potential prosecution. Farmers are cautioned not to counsel commercial applicators to apply pesticides not registered for the use intended or to direct applications to occur under known circumstances that could cause damage (such as under windy conditions). Should such actions result in charges being laid, this may subsequently cost the   

farmer time in court and payment for the remediation of damaged crops, shelterbelts, gardens, etc.   

Buffer strips should be left when applying pesticides next to sensitive crops, watersheds and farmsteads. The size of these strips may be specified on the pesticide label, but if not, the size will depend on the chemical used, the application method and the degree of risk from escaping drift. Pesticide applications conducted near rivers, creeks, lakes, irrigation canals or other open bodies of water require extra care and caution to ensure water users will not be affected by the proposed pesticide application and that the application is conducted in a manner that will not adversely affect aquatic or riparian habitats.   

Ideally, natural vegetation should be left along natural water bodies to ensure bank stability and to provide a natural buffer and filter for agricultural chemicals. A Special Use Approval must be obtained from Alberta Environment to perform pesticide applications within 30 metres of an open body of water when the adjacent land is unimproved rangeland, pasture or woodlot. Certified applicators applying pesticides within 30 metres of an open body of water do not require a Special Use Approval as long as the pesticide they are using is identified in the Environmental Code of Practice for pesticides and they are following the conditions of application specified in the code.   

## 2. Recommended drift reduction practices   

Spray quality, boom height and travel speed are the main factors under operator control. Follow these guidelines to manage drift damage.   

1. Survey the area surrounding the field and identify sensitive areas. Consider waiting until wind direction is most favourable.   

2. Maintain low boom heights. Adequate overlap of 80-degree nozzles can be achieved at a 20-inch boom height. 110-degree nozzles can be operated as low as 15 inches above target. Conduct visual assessment to ensure that the spray patterns produce at minimum a double overlap. This means the edges of the spray pattern should reach the adjacent nozzle locations.

3. Choose products that have lower buffer zones or are compatible with coarser sprays. Spray the coarsest spray quality that will provide adequate coverage for the product and pest. In most cases, an ASABE coarse spray is fine enough for good coverage at water volumes recommended on the pesticide label. Even coarser sprays can be used for systemic products and broadleaf weeds.   

4. Formulation type can affect the droplet size produced by spray tips. Water-soluble solution (S) formulations typically produce finer sprays, whereas oily EC formulations suppress the production of fines. Some adjuvants can help reduce spray drift although spray pressure and nozzle selection will have a larger impact. Such adjuvants are useful when the pesticide effectiveness may be reduced with a spray quality that is too coarse.   

5. Slower travel speeds allow the spray to move towards the target more quickly. Greater speeds create a larger airborne spray plume that may be displaced behind the sprayer. Slower speeds also allow for more consistent boom heights.   

6. Higher water volumes require larger nozzles that typically produce coarser sprays. More water provides an opportunity for coarser sprays without sacrificing coverage.   

7. Spray perpendicular to the wind, starting at the downwind side of the field. Spray headlands at lower spray pressures to increase droplet size. Additionally, spray such headlands on the downwind edge of the field so the remainder of the field can be sprayed at more normal pressures.   

## Spraying weather   

Sprayer adjustments alone don’t guarantee product performance or protect from spray drift. The following actions contribute to better applications.   

1. Use forecasting services with good wind speed and direction capabilities to assist in planning an operation.   

2. Use the directional consistency of wind as a planning tool.   

3. Measure wind speed locally using a weather station or hand-held device. Official wind speeds are reported at a height of 10 metres where wind speed is usually greater than it is closer to the ground where drift is generated.   

4. Spray on sunny days if possible. Solar heating creates thermal turbulence that helps disperse any spray drift.   

5. Do not spray between dusk and dawn if skies are clear and winds are low. These times coincide with formation of temperature inversions that prevent spray dispersion and can cause long-distance transport of the spray cloud.   

6. Extremes of air humidity during windy conditions can increase spray drift problems. Low humidity increases evaporation rates that reduce droplet size and increasing drift potential before deposition. When using fine sprays, high humidity can extend the life of smaller droplets, prolonging the damage that drifting droplets cause.   

7. High temperatures increase the vapour loss of volatile products. Volatile products should not be sprayed during, or prior to, high air temperatures.   

   

## Responding to a pesticide related concern   

The Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act   

prohibits any person from causing adverse effects when using pesticides. Farmers who witness or suspect a pesticide drift or runoff that could affect their family, pets or livestock or cause an adverse effect to their shelterbelt, crop or their land should take the following actions to protect themselves  and assist in an investigation that may result at a  later date.   

• Immediately request family members take shelter indoors to protect themselves from exposure. Close all windows and air conditioning units in the home. If spray has settled on them, they should immediately remove clothing and wash exposed skin. If physical symptoms develop, seek medical assistance or call the Poison & Drug Information Service at 1-800-332-1414.   

• Pets should be removed from the immediate spray area or where drift has occurred.   

• If livestock are at risk, the applicator should be asked to stop the application until the livestock  can be removed or conditions change so the wind is blowing away from the livestock.   

• If drift has occurred in the farmyard, outdoor furniture and play equipment should be washed before use. Garden produce, berries and fruit   

23   

23   

back to Table of Contents   

should not be harvested or consumed and should be monitored for discolouration. If the produce shows signs of damage, it should be destroyed. If berries or fruit trees show signs of damage, the berries or fruit should not be eaten. If no signs of damage occur after 1 to 2 weeks (depending on the pesticide), then all produce, berries and fruit should be washed thoroughly.   

• Record as much detail as possible about the application equipment.This may include colour, type, make, model, licence plate number and additional distinguishing features as well as company information displayed on nurse trucks and aircraft call numbers. If possible, take pictures.   

• Record every detail regarding the occurrence including date, time, weather conditions and type of crop being sprayed. The type of pesticide being applied may be determined by containers found at the site. Also note the description of persons carrying out or assisting the application as well as other witnesses.   

• Attempt to contact the adjacent landowner and indicate your concerns.   

• Contact the Alberta Environmental Response Centre at 1-800-222-6514 promptly for information and assistance in investigating the concern. Some pesticides degrade quickly, so prompt investigative action is required to  proceed with enforcement action.   

## Pesticide residues found in Alberta water sources   

The Alberta Environmentally Sustainable Agriculture (AESA) Stream Survey was initiated in 1999 and continued until 2006. It tested the water quality in  23 watersheds throughout the agricultural areas of the province several times each year. This produced information on the presence and distribution of 68 possible pesticide residues in the water. 4 of the watersheds received irrigation return flows and the rest were dryland.   

Pesticide residues were commonly found in survey water samples. Keep in mind that testing processes are able to detect very small amounts of chemical, far below any observable effect. Maximum pesticide concentrations were typically found in spring and  also coincided with summer pesticide application. Concentrations of detected pesticides occasionally exceeded existing water quality guidelines for either the protection of aquatic life or irrigation use.   

This study highlights the importance of using due care and attention when applying pesticides as they do not necessarily remain where they are applied. Use integrated pest management strategies to improve  the impact of applied pesticides and established benchmarks for the use of registered pesticides. The Farmer Pesticide Certificate program is an excellent example of training for the when, where and how to use pesticides.   

## Pesticide applicator certificate   

Anyone applying pesticides (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides or rodenticides) on property not owned, rented or leased by them or in exchange for a fee must hold a Pesticide Applicator Certificate (issued by Lakeland College) and a Pesticide Service Registration (issued by Alberta Environment). If someone is offering to spray your property, ask to see a Pesticide Service Registration and a Pesticide Applicator Certificate (all applicators are issued wallet-sized identification cards).   

For questions pertaining to pesticide applicator certification, please call Lakeland College at  1-866-853-8646. For questions pertaining to service registrations, contact the nearest regional office of Alberta Environment.   

Please remember that a certificate is not a guarantee of performance. A certificate only certifies the certificate holder has met a minimum standard of knowledge; it cannot assess an applicator’s integrity or the honesty of his business practices. If you are uncertain about the reliability of a particular applicator, ask for references.   

## Farmer certification requirements   

Pesticide manufacturers and the federal Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA), in consultation with provincial agriculture and environment departments across Canada, have agreed that some pesticides have higher toxicity and/or greater potential to adversely affect health or the environment and require farmers to obtain further knowledge to purchase and use them. This means farmers must take a course and pass an exam verifying they have the knowledge to safely and effectively manage and apply these pesticides on their own property. Currently, pesticides containing the active ingredient aluminum phosphide require mandatory certification for farmers to purchase and use. In addition, a fumigation management plan must be developed prior to the treatment and an appropriate self-contained breathing   

24   

back to Table of Contents   

know you are concerned about them and their property and want them to be able to take whatever action they believe is necessary before spraying to reduce the potential exposure to the pesticide.   

## Disposal of pesticide treated seed   

Seed treated with a fungicide, fungicide mixture or fungicide-insecticide combination can be very toxic and should be treated with respect. A blue or red colouration on seed indicates it is pesticide-treated. Extra care must be taken during the transport and disposal of pesticide treated seed to prevent domestic animals, birds and other wildlife from consuming  the treated seed.   

SpillageTo prevent treated seed spillage, move treated seed in labelled, marked bags. Open container transport is not recommended. Bags should be checked for damage and containers should be sealed or lined with plastic or other suitable material. Truckloads of seed should be tarped down securely to avoid possible highway spillage. Treated seed blowing off along the road can kill birds. All treated seed and seed treatment residue should be placed into the seeder at planting time and never dumped in a field. Never leave surplus treated seed unburied. Spills of treated seed can kill deer or cattle that consume it. Any spilt seed should be buried. Incorporate granular pesticides immediately after application to prevent birds and other wildlife from consuming them.   

DisposalNormally, treated seed is planted within 1 or 2 years of treatment. Consider disposing of bagged or loose seed that is old or of diminished viability. Such treated seed should be mixed with new seed and planted at higher rates or seeded by itself. For example “old canola seed” can be mixed and sown with new canola seed or overseeded alone along field margins or low areas. If disposal is necessary, check with your local landfill authority before disposing in  a sanitary landfill. Ensure the treated seed is covered immediately after dumping.   

Pesticide disposalUnwanted or out-of-date pesticides should be disposed of safely and responsibly. Pesticides  are hazardous wastes and cannot be disposed of in sanitary landfills or by burning. If you will not be  able to use pesticide supplies, check to see whether  a neighbour may have some use for them. Make sure the product is retained in the original container and   

apparatus (SCBA) must be available for use at the application site. Farmers must read the entire label and follow all the requirements and restrictions. Aluminum phosphide is used to treat stored grain pests and for rodent control in the field.   

Farmers are encouraged to consider obtaining a Farmer Pesticide Certificate. The course contains detailed grain fumigation and rodent management information that can assist in preventing outbreaks and managing them more effectively when they occur. The Environmental Farm Plan further encourages farmers to learn more about safe and effective handling, use, application, storage, transportation and disposal of pesticides. The Farmer Pesticide Certificate course has been developed for farmers and meets the Standard for Pesticide Education, Training and Certification in Canada. Not only does it provide farmers with essential information, it also provides evidence to consumers that farmers hold current knowledge required to safely and effectively apply pesticides.   

For more information on the Farmer Pesticide Certificate, contact the Ag-Info Centre or your local fieldman.   

Note: The Farmer Pesticide Certificate does not qualify the holder to apply pesticides for other farmers or for a fee.Farmers wanting to provide any pesticide application service outside their own property must obtain a Pesticide Applicator Certificate. The training materials and examinations for this certificate are offered through Lakeland College at 1-866-853-8646.   

## Notification of neighbours before  applying pesticides   

It is strongly recommended that you notify your neighbours prior to spraying or having your crop sprayed, particularly if your fields border your neighbour’s farmstead or other sensitive areas  (e.g., where beehives, gardens or shelterbelts may  be located). Many potentially harmful situations can be avoided if you talk to your neighbour and advise what and when you anticipate spraying. Let them know whether you will spray by ground or by air (noise from low flying aircraft has been known to cause panic in livestock). Also ask if your neighbour  is planning events (e.g., family reunions, picnics) where a number of people may be gathered and could potentially be exposed to pesticides from your application. By notifying your neighbours, you are  not seeking their consent, but rather letting them

has the label/booklet attached to it. Pesticides that have no further use must be disposed of through a qualified (approved) hazardous waste disposal firm. Names of companies that are licenced to handle hazardous waste can be obtained by contacting  the Alberta Recycle Information Line toll-free at 1-800-463-6326 or in Edmonton at 780-427-6982.   

## Water protection   

The preservation of surface water is critical to our sustained quality of life and agricultural production. Surface water throughout Alberta has been monitored for a number of years. Monitoring data collected over a 7-year period indicated that 98% of more than 3,000 samples contained at least 1 pesticide active ingredient. The majority of the pesticides found in surface water are shown to have originated from either agricultural or urban areas. Farmers must take the necessary steps to prevent pesticides from continuing to enter surface water. Pesticides can be carried to a water body in 3 ways:   

• spray drift from application equipment   

• water runoff from farmland   

• attached to soil and carried by wind   

The greatest protection of surface water occurs by maintaining vegetation (trees, shrubs and grasses) surrounding small streams, rivers and lakes. This riparian vegetation acts as a filter to protect surface waters. Where the riparian vegetation no longer exists, grass buffers should be left next to water to help filter the runoff from agricultural land. Additional protective actions can also assist in protecting water.   

• Pesticide must not be stored or mixed or application equipment cleaned within 30 metres of any water body and water sources including wells and dugouts.   

• Pesticides subject to leaching should not be used on coarse-textured soils (i.e., sandy or gravelly) to prevent groundwater contamination.   

• Never store pesticides in well houses.   

• Haul water to your sprayer and fill it in the field rather than taking the sprayer near the water source.   

• Do not leave sprayers unattended while filling.   

• Empty pesticide containers should never be left near a water body.   

• Where possible, spray when wind is blowing away from the water body.   

• Have an emergency pesticide spill kit available when mixing pesticides.   

## Pesticide container disposal   

Triple rinsing or pressure rinsing of pesticide containers is the recommended method of cleaning them prior to disposal. Triple rinsing renders used pesticide containers (metal, plastic, glass) more than 99% free (less than 1 ppm) of residues in most cases. There are a number of systems for pressure rinsing. The simpler style consists of a hollow spike connected to a water line, which injects water under pressure into the jug, which is then drained into the spray tank. A newer style consists of a small hopper mounted on the sprayer with a sharp metal jug opener and a pressure rinse nozzle in the bottom of the hopper. The full jug is inserted on the jug opener, which drains the chemical into the tank. Wash water is injected under pressure to rinse the container. The chemical and rinse solution is then pumped into the spray tank by direct hose connections.   

Unrinsed containers have the potential to contaminate soil, ground water and surface water, and can be toxic to fish and wildlife. Unrinsed containers impede the processing and recycling of empty pesticide containers, as containers must be emptied, and workers are exposed to the residue. Residues can be transported to the atmosphere during storage, processing, shipping and energy recovery, or they can contaminate end products from plastic recycling processes. In addition,  it is estimated that 6 to 7% of product can be left in unrinsed containers. This amount of material  can treat between 1/2 and 1 acre of land and result in the saving of several dollars.   

It is the responsibility of the farming community to ensure their empty pesticide containers are directed to a designated collection site, whether it is a municipal site or back to the point of purchase (depending on the product and size of container). Determine the correct disposal site at the time of purchase.   

Containers disposed of at a container collection site are to be clean (triple rinsed or pressured rinsed)  and well drained (dry). Paper bags and cardboard containers that contained pesticides should be thoroughly emptied and disposed of at a sanitary landfill. Do not burn paper bags or cardboard containers.   

Under the Alberta Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act, non-refillable plastic or metal pesticide containers (restricted, agricultural and industrial products) must be disposed of at a  pesticide container collection site.   

26   

back to Table of Contents   

Outer packaging (cardboard box) and paper booklets (affixed to plastic containers) can be disposed of in  a regular landfill, or they can be recycled if non-contaminated. The presence of the paper attached  to the containers that are to be recycled impairs the quality of the plastic, which will be used for other  end products. Some pesticide container sites have bins or separate areas for collecting outer packaging and label materials.   

## Steps to follow for manual triple rinsing   

(without using a pressure rinse system).   

• Empty contents of the container into the spray tank and drain in a vertical position for 30 seconds.   

• Add water to container to about 1/5 capacity.   

• Shake the container thoroughly, empty into  the spray tank and drain for 30 seconds.   

• Repeat the procedure 2 more times. This should take about 5 minutes in total.   

• Triple rinsed containers should be punctured or broken to render them non-reusable. Punctured containers also identify themselves as being triple rinsed. Note: Do not puncture unrinsed containers. Pesticide found within unrinsed containers is concentrated material. Puncturing an unrinsed container will cause it to leak. This will expose the environment and persons handling the container to its contents.   

• Dispose of all plastic and metal containers at a pesticide container collection site (see list).   

## Pesticide spill cleanup   

The best way to minimize the effects of a pesticide spill is to have an emergency response plan prepared and in place. This should include a copy of the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) and an established procedure to handle all types of pesticide emergency. In addition, a spill cleanup kit should be prepared and be available near the pesticide storage site and at the mixing and loading site. A spill cleanup kit should include the following:   

• personal protective equipment (see the Protective Clothing and Equipment section)   

• absorbent material such as activated charcoal, vermiculite, dry coarse clay, kitty litter or commercial absorbent. Contaminated absorbents can be disposed at a sanitary landfill   

• neutralizing material as indicated on the SDS   

• long-handled broom for dry formulations   

• shovel for liquid formulations   

• waste-receiving container with a lid   

• blank labels to identify contents of waste container   

In the event of a pesticide spill, follow these steps.   

• Isolate affected area.   

• Put on protective clothing and equipment.   

• Ventilate the area (if indoors). For outdoor spills, work from the upwind side of the spill.   

• If possible, stop the containers from further leaking.   

• Contain the spread of the spill using soil, sand bags, vermiculite, kitty litter, etc. to provide a barrier to the spread of the spill. Prevent pesticide entry into sewers or water supply.   

• Report the spill immediately (if into or threatening a watercourse or if the pesticide is or will cause an adverse effect off your property).   

• Clean up the spilled pesticide. Absorb spill on paper, sand, dirt or other inert material (e.g., kitty litter). Contaminated absorbents can be disposed at a sanitary landfill.   

• Decontaminate the spill area by washing the site with detergent or other cleaning products such as ammonia. Check the product label SDS (safety data sheets) or contact the manufacturer for advice on cleanup procedures (most products have a 1-800 customer service number on the label) and disposal. If the spill is large, evacuate the area and notify safety personnel.   

Emergencies or spills must be reported to the  24-hour Alberta Environmental Response Centre:  1-800-222-6514.   

The CleanFarms initiative offers a free empty pesticide container recycling program. The program requires pesticide containers to be pressure rinsed or triple rinsed. Paper booklets must be removed and the clean, empty containers can be returned to a pesticide container site (see following pages). For more information, contact your local collection site or visit www.cleanfarms.ca. Drums and totes (23 L and over) can be returned to the point of purchase.   

Visit www.cleanfarms.ca for the most up to date list of   

collection sites.

## Safety precautions   

## Warning symbols   

Visual warning symbols on pesticide labels indicate the kind of harm that can result from pesticide misuse or mishandling. They alert the user to the degree of the hazard (by the shape of the border) and to the type of hazard (by the centre picture). Precaution symbols help communicate the type and degree of hazard; however, they do not tell you everything you know about working safely with the pesticide. The Precautions section of the product label will provide more details about the specific hazards of the product and precautionary measures that should be taken.   

## Flammable   

The “fire” symbol is a warning the pesticide is flammable or easily ignited. Keep the pesticide away from heat, sparks and open flames. Do not smoke while mixing or applying the product.   

## Explosive   

The “exploding grenade” symbol indicates the pesticide can explode (e.g., pesticide in pressurized cans). Explosive conditions may also be created by using Roundup or Rustler (glyphosate) in a galvanized steel spray tank.   

## Corrosive   

The “corroded hand” symbol indicates that the pesticide is corrosive to the skin and eyes. The chemical is either acid or alkali (caustic) and can burn the skin. Protect the skin and eyes when using these products.   

## Poisonous   

The “skull and crossbones” symbol warns that the chemical is poisonous if taken into the body. Keep the product out of reach of children. Use the appropriate safety measures when dealing with poisonous products.   

The following table relates the oral LD50   

value (mg/kg) of a   

pesticide to its toxicity symbol.   

LD50   

greater than 2,500 mg/kg indicates very low toxicity   

LD50   

1,000 - 2,500 mg/kg indicates low toxicity   

LD50   

500 - 1,000 mg/kg indicates moderate toxicity

## Pesticide toxicity, hazard and risk   

The terms “toxicity,” “hazard” and “risk” do not all have the same meanings. Users of pesticides should understand how the meanings of these terms differ.   

Pesticides vary in toxicity or the degree to which they are poisonous. A pesticide’s degree of toxicity depends on its inherent chemical and physical properties.   

The relative hazard posed by a pesticide depends on the toxicity of the pesticide, the dose received and the length of time exposed. No hazard exists when the pesticide container is sealed, but once the seal is broken and the pesticide is handled, exposure can occur and a hazardous situation is created.   

Risk of exposure is a function of how an individual handles the product. Although the hazard may be  the same whenever a pesticide is being poured into the spray tank, the risk is different if 1 person wears a hard hat, goggles, respirator, nitrile gloves, waterproof apron and neoprene or rubber boots and the other person wears none of these. A knowledge  of the toxicity of a product and the potential for personal exposure can be used to lower the risk of exposure. The user can control the risk by carefully managing the hazard. Even when highly toxic pesticides are used, if the degree of exposure is kept low enough, the risk can be kept at an acceptable level. The toxicity of the pesticide can’t be changed but the risk can be managed.   

LD50   

values are used to rate the toxicity of the pesticides. The LD50   

is the abbreviation used to indicate the lethal dose of a chemical that would kill 50% of an animal population in a test group (expressed in milligrams per kilogram of body weight of the test animal). For example, if a pesticide has an oral LD50   

value of 10 mg/kg and the test animals each weigh 1 kg, 50% of the animals would  die of poisoning if each ate 10 mg of the pesticide.   

## The smaller the LD50   

## value, the more toxic the pesticide. The LD50   

value usually refers to the active ingredient in the pesticide formulation. In this publication, the LD50   

of the formulated product is  also given when available.   

## Symptoms of poisoning   

The symptoms of a suspected poisoning may vary depending on the person’s age, the type of poisonous substance, the amount of poison involved and how much time has passed since the poisoning occurred. Sometimes a poison doesn’t cause any symptoms. Some common symptoms that might indicate a poisoning include:   

## • Nausea and vomitting   

## • Cramps   

## • Throat pain   

## • Drooling   

## • Sudden sleepiness, confusion or decreased alertness   

## • Anxiousness, nervousness, irritability or tremors   

## • Seizures   

## • Substance residue or burn around the mouth, teeth, eyes or on the skin   

## • Trouble breathing   

## • Headache   

In case of poisoning, immediatiely contact a poison control centre, hospital or medical doctor for advice. Have the pesticide container available or the products safety data sheet so you can give complete information, such as what the substance is, how much was taken and when.  Do not try to make the victim vomit.

## Safety   

back to Table of Contents   

Reducing the risk of exposure through the skin is possible through the careful selection, use and care  of protective clothing and safety equipment. Protective clothing and equipment can provide a barrier that reduces contact between the skin and pesticides. See the section on Protective Clothing and Equipment for recommended wear. To help reduce pesticide build-up, clothing should be washed daily using recommended procedures: see Cleaning of Clothes and Equipment section.   

## How skin is exposed to pesticides   

• Direct handling of pesticides may include any activity in which the pesticide could come into direct contact with the skin. This could occur as a result of spills and splashes during mixing and handling of the concentrated pesticide, during equipment adjustment and from spray drift during application. The greatest risk occurs when the chemical concentrate is being handled and extra protection should be used at that time. The use of a waterproof apron is highly recommended when handling all pesticide concentrates regardless of toxicity.   

• Pesticide transfer from contaminated clothing or equipment: clothing worn during pesticide use should be restricted to that use only, thereby eliminating the possibility of continued dermal exposure due to pesticide residues that remain on the clothing. Some types of concentrated pesticides are not removed by multiple washings. Clothing contaminated by accidental spills of concentrated pesticide should be discarded rather than laundered. Avoid entering equipment or living quarters wearing contaminated clothing and equipment. Pesticides may be transferred from boots to floors and carpets where children and pets may be exposed.   

• Transfer of pesticides to clothing not exposed to pesticide concentration: do not wash contaminated garments in the same wash cycle as regular family laundry items. Pesticides can be transferred to other clothing during the laundering process.   

• The use of a chemical resistant apron is highly recommended when handling all pesticide concentrates regardless of toxicity   

## Protective clothing and equipment   

Even pesticides not absorbed by the skin may still cause skin problems such as redness, blisters or dry scaliness, which may lead to serious skin eczema and

## Reducing the risk of exposure to pesticides   

Pesticides may enter the body through the skin (dermally), the mouth (orally) or the nose (inhalation).   

## Skin   

Absorption through the skin is the most common  route of exposure. Various areas of the body absorb pesticides at differing rates. For example, assuming the forearm is given an absorption rate of 1, the relative absorption rate of pesticides in the ear canal is 5.4, on the scalp 3.7, on the forehead 4.2 and the genital area 11.8 or almost 12 times greater than the forearm.   

The genital area and the head are the areas where absorption is the greatest.

dermatitis. Good personal hygiene is important to help minimize pesticide absorption through the skin. Shower, shampoo your hair and put on clean clothing immediately after you finish using pesticides for the day or after an accidental spill. Cuts and scrapes should be cleaned and bandages changed after handling pesticide to avoid possible dermal absorption from contaminated bandages.   

## Eyes   

Eyes are very sensitive to pesticides and can be exposed to vapour or fumes, dust, spray drift or accidental spills and splashes when containers of liquid concentrates are being opened or when the concentrated chemical is being poured into the sprayer tank. Do not wear contact lenses when mixing or applying pesticides.   

## Ears   

Sprays and spills may contaminate the head and  ear canal.   

## Nose   

Pesticides can enter the body when fumes, dust or spray mist is inhaled. Fumes and extremely fine particles of dust or spray can be completely absorbed by the lungs. To minimize exposure, respirators should always be worn when opening and mixing concentrated pesticides. Read the pesticide label and follow the precautions outlined. A respirator may be required when applying pesticides. Reference the safety data sheet to determine the appropriate respirator to use.   

## Mouth   

Pesticides can enter the body through the mouth when users eat, lick their lips or smoke when hands are contaminated. Face and hands should be washed thoroughly prior to eating or smoking. Children may be poisoned if they drink pesticides stored in pop bottles. All pesticides must be stored in their original containers and should be placed in a locked area out of reach of children.   

## Coveralls   

Wear coveralls that are closed at the neckline and wrists. Wear these over full-length pants and long-sleeved shirts. Where appropriate, duct tape may be used where the sleeve cuffs come over the gloves or the pant leg cuffs come over the boots to help keep fine particles from getting inside the coveralls.   

## Minimum protection   

• Cloth: If cotton or cotton/polyester coveralls are worn, they should be washed after daily use.  Some pesticides are difficult to remove from cloth.   

• Disposable, nonwoven: A number of limited-use, disposable, nonwoven, hooded coveralls are now on the market. Rather than laundering, dispose of these at an approved landfill, thus avoiding the necessity of decontamination. Not all disposables are suitable for pesticide use, especially for liquid pesticides. Check with your supplier.   

## Extra protection   

• Coveralls are available that provide greater durability and are more repellent to larger pesticide spills. However, they are more expensive and must be specially ordered. These coveralls  are uncomfortable when worn for long periods  because of heat build-up and lack of breathability in hot weather.   

• Impermeable rainwear: Coveralls and 2-piece suits are available. They are similar in price to the more expensive disposable coveralls. Generally, they are comprised of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) on nylon. Although they repel liquid well, they do not breath, can become uncomfortable and cannot be worn for long periods in hot conditions. After use, they should be hosed down and washed with soap and water.   

## Remember, when using disposable coveralls . . .   

• Before purchasing disposable coveralls, make sure they are recommended by the manufacturer for pesticide use. Avoid wearing all-purpose disposables.   

• When removing disposable coveralls, take care not to contaminate the interior if the coveralls are to be worn more than once. Between wearings, hang in a well ventilated area away from other clothing.   

• Do not launder disposables, but do launder  all clothing worn under disposables, just as you would other clothing worn during pesticide use.   

• Replace with a new coverall when severe pilling (balls of fibre on the surface), rips or holes occur. To discard, place in a plastic garbage bag and take to an approved landfill site; do not burn.

## Safety   

back to Table of Contents   

Do not continue to wear contaminated gloves and avoid wearing leather, cloth or natural rubber gloves as they soak up the chemical and become a source  of continuous contamination.   

## Boots   

Neoprene overboots or long rubber boots are the recommended footwear as they are less likely to absorb pesticides and are more easily cleaned. Be  sure to wear the pant leg over the boot to avoid pesticides running down into the boot. In case of  such an accident, wash the boots out immediately. Otherwise, wash the outside of the boots daily.   

## Minimum protection   

Prevent powders, dusts and spray mists from being deposited on the hair or scalp by wearing a hard hat. The hard hat should be washed daily. Avoid the use  of a hard hat with a leather inner band.   

## Minimum protection   

A minimum level of protection is required when working with dilute, less toxic or granular pesticides. Where there is a direct contact with the pesticide, take extra protection.   

Hard hatwide brimmed, no leather liner   

Coverallscloth or disposable (wear closed at neck, over long-sleeved shirt and full-length pants)   

Glovesunlined, nitrile or neoprene (cuff gloves and wear sleeves over gloves)   

Bootsneoprene overboots or high rubber boots (wear pants outside boots)   

## Extra protection   

Extra protection is required for mixing, loading and handling pesticide concentrates, especially when working with highly toxic pesticides. Check pesticide label.

## Hooded coveralls   

chemically resistant (when mixing, loading or applying very toxic pesticides and when application drenches applicator)   

## Waterproof apron   

(when handling all concentrated pesticides)   

## Gloves   

Unlined gloves are required when handling, mixing  or pouring concentrated pesticides, during field application and when equipment needs adjusting. Never use bare hands to do these jobs. Studies reveal that the greatest exposure is often through the hands. A variety of glove materials may be found on the market. Unlined nitrile and neoprene gloves are suitable for most pesticides. All gloves should be washed soon after the concentrated chemical has been mixed as pesticide may penetrate into the material if it is not cleaned off. Care should be exercised to avoid contaminating the interior of gloves when they are taken off and put on. If possible, wash the outside of the gloved hands prior to glove removal to avoid contaminating the interior. At the end of the day, both the inside and outside of the glove should be washed.   

Prior to use, inspect gloves and replace immediately if cracks, swelling, discolouration, holes or rips develop. Cuff glove and wear sleeves over top of gloves to help prevent pesticide spills and splashes from running down inside the gloves.

## Safety   

back to Table of Contents   

## Extra protection   

Protect hair, scalp, ears and neck from dust, sprays and spills when you are likely to contaminate the head area. Wear a wide brimmed hat that covers the neck or hooded coveralls with the hood under the hard hat. Only wear ear plugs if required for hearing protection. Use disposable ear plugs made of self-moulding foam and dispose of them after use.   

## Goggles or face shields   

Protect the eyes and face against pesticide vapours, dust and splashes when handling concentrated pesticides. Goggles and face shields must be resistant to chemicals and be ventilated to prevent fogging. Clean after each day of use and store away from direct sunlight.   

## Respirators   

•  In order to be used effectively, the people using respirators need to be trained in their use, care, maintenance, and limitations.   

•  It may be beneficial to note that while an N95 respirator is a respirator, it may not be suitable in most instances.   

•  Tight fitting respirators, such as an N95, elastomeric half-facepiece and elastomeric full facepiece respirator must seal tightly where the surface of the respirator contacts the skin of the face.   

•  There are many different types of cartridges, filters, and combination cartridges; these are designed to filter out different types of chemical contaminants. For this reason, it is important to refer to the pesticide label and safety data sheet (if one is available) for guidance when selecting the correct type of cartridge.   

•  If your respirator is re-usable, wash it after each use according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.   

•  Never attempt to wash a filter or cartridge.   

•  Avoid touching used filters or cartridges as they will have some level of contamination and will contaminate any surfaces they come into contact with.   

•  It is not recommended and can be harmful to wait until you can sense the pesticide before you change a filter or cartridge. Refer to the manufacturers recommended service life for the particular filter or cartridge and change it out accordingly.   

## Avoid wearing   

These materials absorb chemicals and  prolong exposure to the wearer; most are  not easily cleaned.   

• fabric baseball caps   

• cloth or leather gloves, shoes or boots   

• natural rubber or plastic gloves  (not resistant to pesticides)   

• leather belts, watch bands and  cell phone holders   

• contact lenses   

•  Cloth masks, medical masks, and dust masks are not respirators and will not protect you or your respiratory tract from pesticides.   

## Gas masks   

These are used when an applicator is likely to be exposed to very high levels of pesticides (fumigants). The face piece covers the eyes, nose and mouth. It is connected by a flexible hose to a charcoal canister worn on the belt. The lifespan of this canister is longer than that of respirator cartridges. Manufacturer’s directions are to be followed for cleaning and storing gas masks and canisters.   

Skin can absorb chemicals from inadequately cleaned clothing and equipment. Safe removal of pesticide demands special care in handling and washing contaminated clothes.   

## Minimize exposure   

• Wear recommended protective clothing and safety equipment.   

• Limit clothing worn for pesticide use to that use only.   

• Wash clothing and equipment daily after use.   

• Replace clothing and equipment that is no longer serviceable.

washing procedures to further reduce the residues on contaminated clothing or equipment. Note that each product requires unique washing procedures, but high residue levels remain in some cases. Refer to the guide in figure 1.   

## Recommendations   

1. 18% residue is an unacceptable level.  For better protection, choose a disposable coverall and discard after use.   

2. Soak contaminated clothing in undiluted limonene for required time. Examples of this product are Odor Crush and Citra-Solv.   

3. Pre-treat contaminated clothing before  washing; let soak.   

4. Fill 70 L washing machine with warm water (50°C); add 280 mL of chlorine bleach. Soak  for required time.  Note: loss of strength and colour results from bleach soak, more so for cotton than for cotton-polyester blends. Note: acceptable residue level is less than 3%.   

## Handling pesticide soiled clothing   

• Handle soiled clothing with unlined, nitrile gloves.   

• Remove pesticide granules from cuffs and pockets outdoors.   

• Discard any garment saturated with pesticide concentrate.   

• Temporarily store clothing in disposable plastic bags before washing.   

• Take disposables to approved landfill.   

## Washing pesticide soiled clothing   

• Separate from regular laundry and wash daily.   

• Wear gloves and protective eyewear when handling products containing bleach and limonene.   

• Pre-treat with a stain removal product if an emulsifiable formulation is used or pre-rinse on washer’s pre-soak cycle.   

• Avoid overcrowding washer.   

• Use hot water setting.   

• Use full water level and normal cycle.   

• Use extra heavy-duty detergent as recommended for heavily soiled loads.   

• Repeat wash procedure.   

• Clean washer after use (run empty washer  through full cycle with hot water and detergent).   

## Drying   

• Line dry to prevent contamination of dryer  and increase the chemical breakdown of  pesticide residues.   

## Washing other equipment   

•   

Wash other equipment daily in hot soapy water: hard hat, goggles, apron, gloves, boots and respirator (avoid getting charcoal wet; remove if possible).   

## Specific cleaning procedures  for pesticides   

The standard washing procedure mentioned above reduces pesticides from contaminated clothing, but new research is gradually identifying more specific

Numbers displayed in parentheses denote recommendations listed on previous page.   

## Fresh water supply   

Always carry a supply of fresh water to clean up accidental spills and a clean pair of gloves for equipment adjustments.   

## Remote control devices   

Devices (e.g., solenoid valves) can be installed to remotely control the sprayer, preferably from within the tractor cab, to reduce exposure to pesticides.   

## Tractor cab cleanup   

After spraying pesticides, the inside of the tractor (seat, steering wheel, etc.) can be decontaminated  by wiping with warm soapy water and a sponge.   

## Tractor cab filters   

Charcoal filters can be fitted to the tractor air intake system to prevent pesticides from entering the cab. The use of these filters is highly recommended to reduce pesticide exposure during spraying operations. Check with tractor manufacturers to determine which charcoal filter is recommended for your tractor.   

## Grazing and haying restrictions   

Traditionally, pesticides have been registered for use on crops grown to maturity. Grazing or cutting of the immature crop for hay was not considered as the intended use, so residue information on the immature plant was not requested in the registration process.  A grazing or haying interval is considered in the registration process only if the green matter is to be fed to livestock. Consequently, many pesticide labels have no statement as to whether or not it is safe to graze the crop(s) listed prior to maturity. The absence of this information may lead farmers to assume  that since there is no specific warning with respect  to grazing, it is safe to do so.   

Present pesticide labelling policy is meant to define only the acceptable uses of the product. It does not list or take into account the “don’ts.” Therefore, it cannot be assumed that if something is not stated on the label, it is accepted for use. A new accepted use can only be made through the submission of relevant data to support that use.   

In light of the above, pesticide labels that are silent  on grazing will carry the following statement: “Don’t graze the treated crops or cut for hay; there is not sufficient data available to support such use.”

## Honey bee safety   

Bees may be affected by pesticides, including those on and associated with treated seed. Spray early in the morning or late in the afternoon when bee activity is at a minimum. Warn beekeepers of your intentions  so they can confine the bees or move them until risk of poisoning bees is over. Imidacloprid is toxic to bees. Dust generated during the planting of treated seed may be harmful to bees and other pollinators.   

For guidance on minimizing dust generated during planting, refer to the following Health Canada webpage: www.healthcanada.gc.ca/pollinators.   

When using a seed flow lubricant with this treated seed, only the Fluency Agent recommended by the registrant is permitted. Carefully follow directions for this seed flow lubricant.   

Do not load or clean planting equipment near bee colonies and avoid places where bees may be foraging such as flowering crops or weeds. When turning on the planter, avoid engaging the system where emitted dust may contact honey bee colonies. Spilled or exposed seeds and dust must be incorporated into the soil or cleaned up from the soil surface.   

## Farm safety   

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is your last line of defense when working with any potentially harmful product. In order to protect the people, animals, and the environment when using pesticides, appropriate consideration must be given to such factors as pesticide selection (i.e., toxicity, some forms are more hazardous than others, etc.), the products ability to harm unintended targets (i.e., people, livestock, wildlife, or environment) and the types of safety equipment and application equipment required.   

The Toxicological Information and First Aid sections of the label will tell list the symptoms of poisoning, practical information about immediate actions to take in the event of an exposure, and treatment information.   

During a medical emergency, such as a poisoning, dial 9-1-1 or go the nearest emergency department as soon as possible.   

Alberta Poison Control Centre is now the Poison and Drug Information Service (PADIS); the telephone number has remained the same.   

The number toll free number can be called 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   

## Alberta Poison Control Centre Calgary, AB  1-800-332-1414   

The emergency departments of most hospitals are equipped to deal with pesticide poisoning. However, the Poison Control Centre can provide information on the identification of poisoning symptoms and the provision of treatment.

## Standard first aid measures   

Always read the first aid measures on the product label prior to use, as they may vary from product to product.   

According to the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, there is not sufficient scientific evidence to support the rinsing or flushing of skin and eyes for 15-20 minutes following contact and recommends the following times:   

•  5 minutes for non-irritants or mild irritants   

•  15-20 minutes for moderate to severe irritants and chemicals that cause acute toxicity if absorbed through the skin   

•  30 minutes for most corrosives   

•  60 minutes for strong alkalis (i.e., sodium, potassium, etc.)   

Before using a pesticide, look for the warning symbol on the label. This label indicates the toxicity of the pesticide. If you are severely exposed to a pesticide and you are alone, do not panic. The symptoms of  the pesticide do not show up immediately. You will have some time to decontaminate yourself.   

## If in eyes   

Rinse eyes with lukewarm running water for 15 to 20 minutes. Get help to take you to the emergency department of the nearest hospital and take the pesticides safety data sheets with you. Do not use  any eye medication unless prescribed by a doctor.   

## If on skin   

Remove any clothing and jewellery that the poison has touched. Rinse skin with lukewarm running water for 15 to 20 minutes. Obtain medical attention  if area of contact is large or if irritation persists.   

## If swallowed   

Call a poison control centre or doctor immediately for treatment advice. Do not induce vomiting unless told to do so by a doctor or poison control centre personnel. Do not give any liquid to the person. Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.   

## If inhaled   

If you or another person have inhaled poisonous fumes, seek fresh air immediately.  Do not put yourself in danger by breathing in poisonous fumes. If person is not breathing, call 911 and request an ambulance for medical assistance, then give artificial respiration if possible.

## Registered tank mixes   

All formulations of 2,4-D may be recommended in tank mix with other products. Consult the label of the tank mix partner product and follow the most stringent set of precautions, restrictions and directions for use.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground applications – barley, corn, rye and wheat –20 - 40 L/acre. Established pasture and rangeland: 40 - 80 L/acre. Non-crop uses – 40 L/acre or more. Turf: 40 - 80 L/acre. Lawns and parks, sod farms and golf courses – 40 - 80 L/acre. Brush species: 400 - 800 L/acre. Aerial applications: 22 - 66 L/acre. Some formulations of 2,4-D may be applied by air. Check the label for detailed instructions.   

Note: Higher application volumes reduce the risk of crop injury.   

## Application tips   

Recommendations vary from label to label; read label of product used. Do not use on sanfoin, bentgrasses or  freshly seeded grass. Spray during warm weather when the weeds are young and growing actively. Do not spray during periods of high temperatures (> 27ºC) when crops may be under stress as damage to the crop may occur.  Do not spray during periods of high winds when spray is likely to drift. Coarse sprays are less likely to drift.   

## How it works   

Systemic, non-selective herbicide. Readily absorbed through leaves or roots. Translocated primarily in phloem  with the sugars but can also move with water in the xylem. Accumulation is primarily in the young, rapidly growing meristematic regions of roots or shoots. It inhibits pigments, including chlorophyll, leading to death.   

## Expected results   

Susceptible plants become malformed before they die.   

## Restrictions   

## Rainfall:   

2, 4-D amine: A rain-free period of 4 hours is needed after application. 2,4-D ester: A rain-free period of 2 hours is needed after application. Grazing: Do not permit lactating dairy animals to graze fields within 7 days after application. Do not harvest or cut treated crops for forage until 30 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter. Re-cropping: No restrictions the year after treatment.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to small mammals, birds, aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Leaching: The use of this chemical may result in contamination of groundwater, particularly in areas where soils are permeable (e.g., sandy soil) and/or the depth to the water table is shallow. Runoff: Reduce risk of runoff by avoiding application on moderate or greater slopes and bare soil.

Fertilizers: For pre-plant incorporated and pre-emergence application, nitrogen solutions or complete liquid fertilizers may replace the water as a carrier. Do not apply after the corn has emerged as there is danger of liquid fertilizer causing crop injury.   

Many dry bulk granular fertilizers may be impregnated with Aatrex or Aatrex plus Dual II Magnum or Eradicane 8E  as a pre-plant incorporated application to control weeds in corn.   

Oil-water emulsions (post-emergent treatment): Atrazine 480.   

Pre-plant-incorporated: Aatrex Liquid 480 (0. 85 - 1.25 L/acre + Dual II Magnum (0.5 - 0.7 L/acre).   

## Application tips   

Continuous gentle agitation is needed. Avoid excessive agitation, especially with oil mixtures as a grease-like mass may form. Use oil mixes at once and clean tank and system with a strong detergent solution. Use 50 mesh or larger strainers and use only metal filters. Bypass line should discharge to bottom of tank. Band treatments are desirable when cultivation is to alleviate hard soil conditions or to control annual weeds.

back to Table of Contents   

## How it works   

A systemic herbicide absorbed through both roots and foliage, and it is translocated to the leaves where it inhibits photosynthesis.   

## Expected results   

Affected plants are slow to emerge and are wilted, yellowish and eventually turn brown and die. Poor weed control may be expected if improper incorporation is done, or when post-emergent application is made without oil concentrate or sprayed too late. Heavy rainfall on sandy soils may cause leaching and a decrease in weed control and/or crop injury.   

## Restrictions   

Re-cropping: Plant only to corn in year of treatment. The use of atrazine on the Prairies is not recommended when corn is grown in rotation with other crops except triazine-tolerant canola. Breakdown of atrazine in the soil is slow and may cause injury to sensitive crops (e.g., cereals, canola, sugar beets) 1 or more years after application. Crops most tolerant after corn and triazine-tolerant canola are sorghum, then flax, faba bean and peas. The risk of damage to succeeding crops from atrazine residues may be reduced by ploughing or deep tilling treated fields in the fall prior to seeding the next crop in the rotation. Spreading and incorporating manure may also help to reduce the atrazine levels. Uneven application, excessive sprayer overlap or applications in excess of recommended rates will not injure corn but may result in a longer carryover of atrazine residues. A prolonged period of dry weather will also lengthen the time that atrazine residues remain in the soil. Rainfall: Rainfall will activate the chemical, carrying it into the root zone where kill will begin. Grazing: Do not graze treated immature crops or cut for fodder.   

Pre-harvest intervals: Sweet corn – 45 days. Field corn – 60 days.   

## Environmental precautions   

Leave at least a 10-metre buffer between treated area and sensitive habitats. Do not mix or load within 30 metres of wells and aquatic habitats such as lakes, ponds, dugouts or sinkholes. Heavy rainfall on sandy soils may cause runoff and leaching. The use of Atrazine may result in contamination of groundwater, particularly on areas where soils are permeable (e.g., sand, loamy sand and sandy loam soils) and/or the depth to the water table is shallow.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) Aatrex = > 5,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Heated storage required. If stored in unheated areas, the product should be warmed and agitated thoroughly prior to using.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground applications only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Warm, moist conditions following application promote the activity of Accent/Nicosh, while cool and/or dry conditions may reduce or delay activity. Poor weed control or crop injury may result from applications made to plants under stress from abnormally hot or cold weather, environmental conditions such as drought, water-saturated soils, hail damage or frost, disease, insect or nematode injury and prior herbicide, or carryover from a previous year’s herbicide application. Delay application until stress passes and both weeds and corn resume growth. If corn has been injured by frost, wait 48 to 72 hours before applying Accent/Nicosh. Severe stress conditions immediately following application may also result in crop injury or poor weed control. Do not apply a foliar organophosphorus insecticide within 7 days before or after applying Accent/Nicosh.   

## How it works   

Accent/Nicosh is a systemic herbicide that is absorbed by the foliage and translocated to the growing points of the plant. Growth of susceptible plants stops shortly after application. It rapidly stops the growth of susceptible species; typical symptoms usually appear within 5 to 7 days, but may not be noticeable for 2 to 3 weeks after application, depending on the prevailing growing conditions.   

## Expected results   

Typical injury symptoms include yellowing, purpling and reddening of the newest leaves and usually appear within 5 to 7 days, but may not be noticeable for 2 to 3 weeks after application, depending upon the prevailing growing conditions. Eventually, the entire plant discolours and dies.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: A rain-free period of 2 to 4 hours is needed after application. Grazing: Do not graze treated crops or cut for hay. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest field corn until 30 days and sweet corn for 40 days after application.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Re-cropping restrictions: Winter wheat may be seeded 4 months after application. Spring cereals, canola, field pea, flax, corn, potato, dry bean*, sunflower, alfalfa may be seeded 10 months after application.   

*Since not all dry bean varieties have been tested for tolerance to Accent/Nicosh, first planting of each variety to previously treated field should be limited to a small area to confirm tolerance prior to general field scale.   

## Environmental precautions   

Accent/Nicosh is toxic to terrestrial plants and aquatic organisms. Leave a buffer zone of at least 2 metres between the downwind point of direct application and the closest edge of sensitive terrestrial and aquatic habitats.

Do not tank mix. Liquid Achieve SC/Bison 400L/Marengo/Nufarm Tralkoxydim with broadleaf herbicides when applying to cereal crops underseeded to forage legumes as the forages may be injured or killed.   

With reduced water volumes, tank mixes with Buctril M, Thumper or Pardner (and associated herbicides) may  result in some initial injury in the form of “tip burn.” This injury, however, will not have an adverse effect on  crop maturity or yield.   

Tank mixes with Attain may cause temporary crop injury if applied before the 4-leaf stage.   

Tank mixes with 2,4-D ester/dichlorprop and Buctril M plus MCPA may cause some injury in barley. Use tank mixing procedure “d” on page 13.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial applications. Water volume: Ground – 20 - 40 L/acre. Air – 12 - 18 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Weed control: Optimum weed control is obtained by applying herbicides when targeted weeds are actively growing. Applying herbicides under stressful conditions (drought, heat, frost, poor soil fertility, flooding or prolonged cool temperature) may delay or reduce weed control. Crop safety: Applications of Achieve SC/Bison 400L/Marengo/Nufarm Tralkoxydim to non-tillered crops exposed to 4°C temperatures before or after spraying should be avoided to prevent the possibility of crop injury. Tillered cereal crops may incur injury if Achieve SC et al are sprayed within 48 hours of freezing temperatures. Sequential applications: Always apply Liquid Achieve SC/Bison 400L/Marengo/Nufarm Tralkoxydim first and allow 5 to 7 days before applying any other non-registered tank mix herbicide. This is especially critical for Group 2 herbicides.   

## How it works   

Tralkoxydim is a systemic herbicide that is absorbed through the leaves and translocated to the growing points  within the plant where it inhibits an enzyme involved in lipid biosynthesis. Thorough coverage of the foliage is important for consistent grass control.   

## Expected results   

Grass growth stops in 48 hours. Young shoots turn brown in 7 to 8 days. Complete death of plant will take 2 to 3 weeks.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: No effect 1 hour after application. Grazing: Immature cereal crops may be grazed, harvested or cut for hay 16 days after treatment. Mature straw may be fed to livestock. Do not feed or graze underseeded forage crops in the year of treatment. Pre-harvest intervals: Immature cereal crops may be grazed or cut for hay 16 days after treatment. Grain may be harvested 60 days after treatment. Mature straw may be fed to livestock. Do not feed or graze underseeded forage crops in the year of treatment; sufficient data are not available to support this use. Re-cropping restrictions:   

Do not replant treated areas to tame oats or corn for at least 4 weeks after application. Other crops: no restrictions.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not apply to any body of water. Do not apply within 15 metres by ground and (50 metres by air) of non-crop areas. This includes fish-bearing waters, wetlands (potholes, sloughs, etc.) and wildlife habitat (hedgerows, rights of way, etc.).   

## Toxicity

Reglone** (0.5 - 0.9 L/acre)   

* Isopropyl amine or potassium salts only. ** For potatoes only.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

Due to rapid absorption by the leaves, translocation is very limited. It is essential to get good plant coverage. Extremes in environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, soil conditions and cultural practices may affect activity. Under warm moist conditions, herbicide symptoms may be accelerated. While under very dry conditions, the expression of herbicide symptoms may be reduced as weeds hardened off by drought are less susceptible. Maximum two applications per growing season.   

## How it works   

Rapidly absorbed by foliage. Inhibits the PPO enzyme involved in chlorophyll and heme synthesis. This action results in leaky cell membranes and rapid browning and death.   

## Expected results   

Initial symptoms are observed within hours and death occurs within a few days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Heavy rainfall shortly after application may reduce  weed control. Grazing: There are no grazing restrictions on the label. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Pre-harvest interval: For registered harvest aid crops. Potatoes – 7 days. All other registered crops – 3 days.   

## Environmental precautions   

Recommended buffer zone of 5 metres from any sensitive habitat without the use of any drift control aids.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 4,077 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Store in a cool, dry place and avoid excess heat. Store above 5°C to prevent freezing.

How to apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 40 L/acre minimum.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “d” as described on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Best results are obtained when Akito is applied to actively growing weeds in the seedling stage and when Canada thistle is between 10 cm and up to but not including the early bud stage. Poor weed control may result under cool and dry conditions.

## How it works   

Group 2 herbicides inhibit the production of the ALS enzyme in plants. This enzyme is essential for the production of certain amino acids essential for plant growth. Group 4 herbicides are synthetic auxins, which act at multiple sites in the plant to disrupt hormone balance and protein synthesis and thereby cause a variety of plant growth abnormalities.   

## Expected results   

The florasulam component inhibits the ALS enzyme in plants resulting in a rapid halt in plant growth followed by yellowing, most noticeable after 1 to 2 weeks. Fluroxypyr will cause uncontrolled growth with distorted plant browning and dying. Clopyralid symptoms include swollen growing points and roots, cupping of leaves, twisted and distorted stems and leaves. Plants will gradually stop growing and change colour, first to dark green and then to yellow before turning brown as they die.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: No restrictions. Grazing: Do not cut the treated crop for hay or graze treated crop within 7 days after application. Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Akito can be seeded the following year to wheat, barley, oat, rye, canola, flax, mustard or field pea. If severe drought conditions are experienced in the months of June to August inclusive in the year of application, delay seeding peas an additional 12 months (total 22 months following application). Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zones.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 3,378 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Store in cool (above 5°C). If product is frozen, bring to room temperature and agitate before use.

MPower Pro – the following products are also registered tank mix partners: Aurora, Clobber M, Foxxy M, Himalaya. See label for specific tank mix options.   

## Mixing instructions   

Refer to mixing instructions “b” on page 15.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground applications only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: Cereal and forage grasses –  40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Effectiveness may be reduced if spray mixture remains in tank for more than 48 hours. Warm, moist growing conditions promote active weed growth and enhances activity, allowing maximum foliar uptake and contact activity. If cold, dry conditions prevail, delay treatment until active weed growth resumes. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed and re-growth may occur.   

## How it works   

Ally is absorbed by the foliage and roots, readily translocated throughout the plant and inhibits cell division.   

## Expected results   

Rapidly inhibits the growth of susceptible weeds; however, typical symptoms (discolouration) of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application depending upon growing conditions and weed susceptibility. Degree of control and duration of effect depend on weed sensitivity, weed size, growing conditions, soil pH and spray coverage.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Heavy rainfall immediately before or after application may cause temporary lightening of crop. Rainfall within 2 to 4 hours of application may lessen degree of weed control. Grazing: Wheat, barley or forage crops may be grazed by or fed to livestock any time after treatment. Re-cropping restrictions: Do not use on soils with pH greater than 7.9. Do not apply to irrigated land where tail water will be used to irrigate other cropland.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

* If land has been treated with Ally and Assert the same year or in successive years, seed only wheat, excluding durum, until a field bioassay demonstrates that other crops can be seeded. When recropping to broadleaf crops following an Ally application, extend the rotational interval by 1 year  if rainfall was less than 130 mm in the Brown and Dark Brown soil zones or 250 mm in the Black and Grey Wooded soil zones in any year within the stated interval prior to planting.   

## Environmental precautions   

Highly toxic to non-target plants. Leave a 15-metre zone between the last spray swath and the edge of any of these habitats. Do not use on highly variable soils that have large gravely or sandy areas, eroded knolls or calcium deposits. Do not contaminate irrigation water. Do not apply within 15 metres of a body of water. Runoff: Do not apply to frozen ground where surface runoff may occur.

## Crops, staging and rates   

CLEARFIELD wheat varieties only. Apply at 3-leaf (after appearance of first tiller) to a 6-leaf stage to ensure optimum crop tolerance. Rate: 67 mL/acre AC299 120AS + 120 mL/acre Starane II + 380 mL/acre of MCPA ester  600 + surfactant. (Non-ionic surfactant at 0.25% v/v of spray solution or 2.5 L per 1000 L spray solution).   

Note: Surfactant not included with Altitude FX3. MCPA 600 not included with Altitude FX3.   

## Weeds and staging   

Grasses: 1 - 4 true leaf stage up until early tillering (maximum 2 tillers).   

Broadleaf weeds: Apply up to 4-leaf stage, unless otherwise indicated.

## Registered tank mixes   

For Altitude FX3 only: MCPA Ester 600 (0.38 L/acre) or 2,4-D Ester 700 (0.32 L/acre); Curtail M (0.61 to 0.81 L/acre).   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “b” on page 15. Add anti-foaming agent last, if needed.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground applications only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Initial crop injury may be observed after application but this is outgrown and should not affect yield. Severe crop injury will occur as a result of spray overlap. Avoid sprayer overlap.   

Do not spray Altitude FX3 if temperatures of 5ºC or lower are forecasted within 3 days of application. Temperatures near freezing (below 5ºC) will prevent optimum herbicide performance, as weeds are not actively growing. Do not apply more than once per year. For best results, treat CLEARFIELD wheat during warm weather when weeds are actively growing and soil moisture is adequate for rapid growth.   

## How it works   

Absorbed through the foliage and roots. Disrupts plant metabolism causing growth to stop within 24 hours.  Visible symptoms appear within 7 to 10 days and, depending on environmental conditions, weed death occurs within 14 to 21 days after application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 3 hours of application may reduce activity. Grazing: Do not graze or silage the treated crop within 14 days of application or cut for hay within 42 days of application. Pre-harvest intervals: Wheat grain and straw can be harvested 79 days after treatment. Re-cropping: The following crops may be grown safely the year following an application: field pea, field corn, canary seed*, Group 2 tolerant canola, non-Group 2 tolerant canola*, lentils, spring wheat, durum wheat*, spring barley, sunflower, tame oats*, flax*, chickpea. The following crop may be grown safely 2 years following an application: mustard* (condiment type only). Winter wheat can be grown 3 months after treatment*. There are insufficient data for other following crops. Conduct a field bioassay (a test strip grown to maturity) the year before growing any crop other than those listed above. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Registered tank mixes   

None registered.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Apply with ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “b” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Water soluble bags will dissolve better when kept intact; do not split bags. If agitation is stopped for more than  5 minutes, re-suspend spray solution by full agitation prior to commencing spraying again. Do not spray Anaconda if temperatures of 5   

0   

C or lower are forecasted within 3 days before or after application. Cold temperatures near freezing will negatively affect herbicide performance, as weeds are not actively growing. Initial transient crop yellowing may be observed after application, but this is outgrown and should not affect yield. Apply Anaconda when broadleaf weeds are small and actively growing and before weeds reach the maximum size recommended for control.  Do not apply Anaconda to field peas that have been subjected to stress from conditions such as hail damage, flooding, drought, hot, humid weather, widely fluctuating temperature conditions, prolonged cold weather or injury from prior herbicide applications, as crop injury may result. Failure to include UAN will result in significantly reduced product performance.   

## How it works   

Bentazon is a contact herbicide that interferes with photosynthesis. Uptake into the plant occurs primarily through the leaves. Thorough coverage of foliage is important for consistent weed control. Imazamox is absorbed by foliage and roots. Disrupts plant metabolism causing growth to stop. Quizalofop-ethyl is a systemic herbicide that is rapidly absorbed and readily translocated from the treated foliage to the root systems and growing points of the treated plants.   

## Expected results   

Initial symptoms such as yellowing may appear within a few days, while complete plant death may take 2 to 3 weeks depending on growing conditions.   

## Restrictions:   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 6 hours of application may reduce activity. Grazing: Do not graze treated field pea or harvest for forage or hay. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not apply within 65 days of harvest. Re-cropping: Winter wheat may be seeded 3 months after application. Canary seed, Group 2 tolerant canola, non-Group 2 tolerant canola, chickpea, field corn, field pea, flax, lentil, oat, barley and spring wheat (including durum), Group 2 tolerant sunflower and sunflower may be seeded the first spring after application and tame mustard the second season after application. A field bioassay (a test strip grown to maturity) is recommended the year before growing any crops other than those listed above. Contact manufacturer for additional information on re-cropping intervals.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Do not apply Anaconda more than once per year.   

## Environmental precautions   

Anaconda tank mixture is highly toxic to non-target plants. Observe buffer zones specified on the label.   

## Toxicity

In Group 2 tolerant canola only: Lontrel XC at 51 mL/acre. Additional weeds controlled: Canada thistle,  annual sow thistle, perennial sow thistle (season-long, top growth control).   

Note: The above mixes are those listed on the Ares SN label only.   

Adding ingredients in the correct order is critical for optimum performance. Check labels of products to be mixed  for directions.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air.   

Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre. When tank mixed with Lontrel XC, 40 L/acre is recommended.   

## Application tips   

Use a combination of nozzles and pressure designed to deliver thorough, even coverage and a minimum of fine droplets that are prone to drift.   

DO NOT spray if temperatures of 5   

°   

C are forecast within 3 days of application. Treat crops during warm weather when weeds are actively growing and soil moisture is adequate for rapid growth. Under cool or dry conditions, control of some weeds may be severely reduced.

## How it works   

Ares SN is absorbed by foliage and roots and disrupts plant metabolism, causing growth to stop. Maximum efficacy results from foliar applications to young, actively growing plants.   

## Expected results   

Susceptible weeds may stop growing within 24 to 48 hours. Yellowed growing points, yellow striping and purplish or reddish discolouration of the leaves may occur. Leaves begin to die in 3 to 10 days, starting with the youngest and moving to the older leaves. Death of the plant may occur in 1 to 3 weeks.   

## Restrictions   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Rainfall: Rainfall within 2 hours of application may reduce activity. Grazing: Not specified. Pre-harvest intervals: DO NOT apply within 60 days of harvesting Group 2 tolerant canola and Group 2 tolerant oilseed Brassica juncea.   

Re-cropping restrictions: Field pea, lentil, Group 2 tolerant canola, canaryseed, barley, field corn, chickpea and spring wheat may be seeded the first full season after application. Flax, canola, durum wheat and sunflower  may be seeded the second full season after application. Sensitivity to injury can vary depending on the crop.  With less than 125 mm rainfall during the growing season, it is recommended you grow field pea, lentil or Group 2 tolerant wheat on Group 2 tolerant canola stubble. If rainfall was less than 125 mm during the growing season (June 1 to August 31) the company recommends growing field peas, lentils or CLEARFIELD wheat on CLEARFIELD canola stubble. The company recommends that a field bioassay (a test strip grown to maturity) be conducted the year before growing any crops other than those listed above.   

## Environmental precautions   

Avoid spraying in situations where drift may occur. Leave a buffer zone of at least 11 metres between the outside boundary of the sprayed area and sensitive areas.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

DO NOT spray if temperatures of 5°C or lower are forecast within 3 days of application. Treat crops during warm weather when weeds are actively growing and soil moisture is adequate for rapid growth. Under cool or dry conditions, control of some weeds may be severely reduced.   

## How it works   

Topramezone is absorbed through foliage and is translocated to the meristematic regions. It inhibits the HPPD enzyme causing bleaching of leaves.   

## Expected results   

Rapid bleaching of leaves within days and plant death within 7 to 14 days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if heavy rain is forecast. Contact manufacturer. Grazing: Do not graze treated fields or cut for feed within 45 days of application. Pre-harvest intervals: 45 days from application to harvest. Re-cropping: At maximum seasonal rate of 15 mL: Winter wheat can be seeded 4 months after application. Canola (all types), spring wheat, field corn, lentil, navy (white) bean, soybean, field pea, potato, flax, sunflower and alfalfa may be seeded the year following 1 application. Maximum seasonal application rate of 30 mL/acre (Armezon only): Winter wheat may be seeded 4 months after application.

## Registered tank mixes   

None.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground applications only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 - 223 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Apply in sufficient water (40 - 223 L/acre) to wet all foliage during periods of active growth. Do not mix or store  in unlined steel (except stainless steel) containers or spray tanks. Do not use where roots from desirable vegetation may extend into the treated area. Maintain a distance from desirable trees equal to at least twice the distance from  the trunk to the drip-line. Do not apply where runoff water may flow onto agricultural land.   

## How it works   

Absorbed by both roots and foliage of sensitive vegetation. Translocated throughout the plant including the root system in both the xylem and the phloem. Non-selective. Plant stops growing shortly after application.

## Expected results   

Plants stop growing within 24 to 48 hours. Yellow, purplish and/or red discolouration of the leaves may occur. The growing point of the plant and the youngest leaves begin to die first, with symptoms eventually progressing to older leaves. Chlorosis and tissue necrosis may not be apparent in some plant species until 2 weeks after application. Complete kill of plants may not occur for several weeks.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 2 hours may decrease foliar activity. Rainfall does not affect root activity or the control of non-emerged sensitive species. Grazing: Do not graze the treated area or cut for hay. Re-cropping: Non-crop/ non-graze applications only. Re-entry interval: Do not enter treated areas until sprays have dried.   

## Environmental precautions   

Arsenal is toxic to non-target aquatic and terrestrial plants. Leave a 20-metre buffer between area of application and sensitive habitats. Do not apply where runoff water may flow onto agricultural land as injury to crops may result.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50

AMVAC, IPCO and Gowan Company support the following unregistered mixes of quizalofop-p-ethyl and glyphosate on Roundup Ready canola, with Pursuit on field pea, with Odyssey NXT on Group 2 tolerant lentils, field pea and soybean with Solo ADV on Group 2 tolerant lentils that are not on the Assure II/Yuma GL/IPCO Contender label. Apply mixes according to the most restrictive use limitations for either product. For field pea and soybean only: Viper ADV. On Group 2 tolerant canola and mustard: Ares SN. Consult manufacturer for surfactant use and mixing instructions.   

## Mixing instructions   

Surfactant required. Check specific type and rate on product label. Use mixing instructions “c” on page 15.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial applications. Water volume: Ground – 40 L/acre. Up to 162 L/acre of water may be used under heavy populations to improve coverage. Air: 10 - 20 L/acre. Consult product label for aerial application guidelines by crop.   

## Application tips   

Avoid ultra-course spray droplet sizes. Grass control may be reduced if applied when the air temperature is less than 10°C and/or drought conditions are present. Poor results may be expected if there is improper mixing, timing or coverage, or when weeds are under stress.   

## How it works   

Quizalofop-p-ethyl is a systemic herbicide that is rapidly absorbed and readily translocated from the treated foliage to the root systems and growing points of treated plants.   

## Expected results   

Grassy weeds show a reduction in growth and a loss of competitiveness. An early yellowing or browning of the younger plant tissues is followed by a progressive collapse of the remaining foliage. These results will generally  be observed in 1 to 3 weeks, depending on the grass species treated and the environmental conditions.   

## Restrictions   

Re-cropping: No restrictions the year after application. Grazing: Do not graze treated fields or harvest for forage or hay. Pre-harvest intervals: Canola – 64 days; chickpea – 85 days; flax – 82 days; lentil or pea (field orprocessing) – 65 days; soybean – 80 days; faba beans – 30 days; industrial hemp – 73 days. Re-entry interval:   

Camelina 4 days. All other registered crops 12 hours. Rainfall: Rain within 1 hour of application may reduce effectiveness.   

## Environmental precautions   

Quizalofop-p-ethyl is toxic to fish. Avoid spraying fish-bearing waters. Leave a 15-metre buffer between treated area  and sensitive habitats.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 40 L/acre minimum.   

Authority 480 herbicide may be applied to the soil as a pre-plant or pre-emergence (to weed and crop) single ground application. Authority 480 herbicide can be applied prior to planting or up to 3 days after planting, but before seed germination. Unless specified on the label, do not make fall application to any crops.   

## Application tips   

All soil applications of Authority 480 require adequate rainfall for herbicidal activation.   

Do not apply Authority 480 (or any sulfentrazone products) in consecutive years (24 months). In case of drought in any of those years, a subsequent application of Authority 480 should be further delayed. Do not apply to soils classified as coarse-textured. Do not apply in fine texture soils with less than 1.5% organic matter. Do not apply in any type of soils with an organic matter content greater than 6%. Do not use on soils with a pH of 7.8 or greater. If using irrigation with water that has a pH greater than 7.5, please review the label for adverse crop response. Rainfall:   

Authority 480 requires 10 to 20 mm of rain or irrigation water, at once, to be effective. Dry weather conditions as well as excessive rainfall or irrigation following application may reduce weed control. Do not store the sprayer overnight or for an extended period of time with the sulfentrazone spray mixture in the tank.   

## How it works   

Sulfentrazone controls weeds by the process of protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibition (membrane disruption), a mode of action commonly referred to as PPO inhibition. Sulfentrazone is primarily taken up by the roots of treated plants.   

## Expected results   

Plants emerging from treated soil turn necrotic and die after exposure to light. Shoot-root soil placement studies indicate that sulfentrazone is primarily absorbed by the roots of the plant following soil applications.   

## Restrictions

Re-cropping: For crops not listed above, a minimum rotational crop interval of 36 months must be observed and a representative bioassay of the field must be conducted with the rotational crop and adequate soil moisture to evaluate potential crop sensitivity. If there is a lack of adequate or normal soil moisture due to drought conditions following an application of AUTHORITY® 480 Herbicide, the minimum rotational crop interval listed in the table must be extended for one additional year that the drought has occurred and a representative bioassay of the field must be conducted with the potential rotational crop and adequate soil moisture to determine the crop sensitivity to AUTHORITY® 480 Herbicide. Do not apply AUTHORITY® 480 Herbicide (or any other product containing   

sulfentrazone) to spring wheat if an application of FOCUS® Herbicide (or any other product containing pyroxasulfone) was applied in the previous fall. Rainfall: Rainfall is required following application to activate the sulfentrazone component and for adequate weed control. Grazing: No restrictions. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application tips   

Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: Minimum of 40 L/acre. Nozzles and pressure: Use a combination of nozzles and pressure designed to deliver thorough, even coverage with ASABE medium droplets. Spray mix must be used immediately; do not store herbicide in spray tank overnight. Use continuous agitation.   

## Expected results   

Moisture is necessary to activate both the sulfentrazone and pyroxasulfone components in soil for effective weed control. Dry weather following application may reduce effectiveness. Extremes in environmental conditions such  as temperature, moisture, soil conditions and cultural practices may affect activity.

## Registered tank mixes   

Fertilizers: Avadex Liquid EC alone or tank mixed with liquid formulations of Treflan or Rival may be tank mixed in a minimum of 36 litres of sprayable fluid fertilizer carrier (such as 28-0-0) per acre as a broadcast treatment. Compatibility of herbicide and liquid fertilizer should be checked.   

Herbicides: Avadex Liquid EC can be tank mixed with Treflan or Rival herbicide for the control of both wild oats and wild millet (green and yellow foxtail). This tank mixture can be applied after seeding wheat and barley only.   

## How to apply   

Avadex Liquid EC can only be applied by ground application. Granular formulations may be applied by air with attachments designed for applying low volumes of granules (Avadex MicroActiv).   

## Application information   

Water volume: Minimum of 36 L/acre. Pressure: 200 kPa.   

## Application tips   

Choice of formulation: Use liquid formulation on soil free of trash. Avadex MicroActiv herbicide may be applied in the fall or spring into standing stubble. If excessive crop residue exists at the time of application, a vigorous harrowing can be used to ensure that the herbicide granules make adequate contact with the soil.   

Fall minimum tillage application: Fall minimum tillage applications should be made when the average soil temperature at the 5 cm depth is 4°C or less and within 3 weeks of soil freeze-up. This situation generally occurs by October 1. Incorporation by harrowing following application in the fall is recommended but can be performed in the spring before seeding. Do not use this treatment on soil with less than 2% organic matter. Under excessively warm or wet conditions between application and crop emergence, control may be reduced. For best results on heavy wild oats infestation, use the incorporated treatments only.   

Spring minimum tillage application: Apply Avadex Liquid EC/MicroActiv granules in the spring when average soil temperature at the 5-cm depth is 4°C or less. Applications should be made to soil that has adequate trash cover to prevent soil erosion between application and seeding. Ensure that the time between application and incorporation is a minimum of 10 to 14 days. Do not apply more than 4 weeks before intended seeding. For optimum results with Avadex Liquid EC minimum tillage treatments, seed when wild oats growth is noticeable in the field. This will ensure that the soil is warm enough for activation of Avadex Liquid EC. Minimum tillage applications should not be made to fields covered with snow or excessive crop residue that will not allow granule contact with soil. If excessive crop residue exists at the time of application, a vigorous harrowing can be used to ensure that the herbicide granules make adequate contact with the soil. Under excessively warm or wet conditions between application and crop emergence, control may be reduced. For best results on heavy wild oats infestation, use the incorporated treatment only. Soil colour may not be a precise indicator of organic matter content. Ensure that the application rate chosen from the table is appropriate for your soil type.   

Conventional tillage: Please refer to the product label for information on application and incorporation recommendations under conventional tillage systems.   

Field preparation: Make sure the soil is in good working condition. Reduce trash to an acceptable level before application. If soil is excessively wet or lumpy, cultivate with suitable equipment to improve soil condition.   

Seeding: Flax, mustard and rapeseed can be seeded in treated layers. Barley and wheat are more sensitive and should be planted 1.5 to 2.5 cm below the treated layer. Wheat must be seeded below the treated layer. After seeding, any deep ridges left by drills must be levelled by harrowing. Treflan/Rival Mixes: Drought conditions in the year of treatment may result in higher levels of Treflan/Rival carryover. To avoid wheat injury, seed 6 to 7.5 cm into warm, moist seedbed. A pre-seeding burn-off herbicide treatment is required to eliminate weed competition prior to crop emergence.

## How it works   

Absorbed by germinating wild oats shoots, usually resulting in death before emergence. Under dry conditions,  wild oats may emerge before being killed.   

## Expected results   

Wild oats: Usually kills wild oats before they emerge. Scraping away the soil 1 to 2 weeks following treatment will expose white to yellow wild oats shoots 2 to 2.5 cm in length with pinched tips. Plants that have emerged and absorbed a lethal dose will cease growth, leaves become brittle and bluish-green in colour. Under dry conditions, a rainfall of 1.5 cm or more when wild oats are emerging can cause post-emergent die-back of a high percentage of wild oats plants. Crop: Wheat seeded into the treatment zone under very dry soil conditions may be thinned and delayed when germinating and emerging just prior to a heavy rainfall.  Wheat must be seeded at least 1.5 cm below the treated layer of soil (e.g., 5 to 7.5 cm). Some wheat thinning may be noted on eroded knolls. Poor results may be expected if incomplete incorporation due to wet, cloddy soil or heavy trash, incorporation delayed, very dry soil conditions in spring or prolonged cool soil temperatures at time of germination. Ridges left by seeding may disrupt the treated layer and allow escapes.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Moisture is required for activation. Rainfall of at least 1.5 cm within 2 weeks of application in the spring is required to ensure maximum performance. Grazing: Treated underseeded legumes cannot be harvested for green feed, silage or hay in year of seeding. Do not graze the treated crop or cut for hay; there are not sufficient data to support such use. Re-cropping: Oats should not be seeded into soil treated with Avadex Liquid EC/MicroActiv in the previous year. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not apply directly to water or to areas where surface water is present. Avoid conditions that may lead to runoff  or leaching. Chemical is mobile in water. Can volatilize so it is important to incorporate when applying and apply when soil temperature is 4°C or less.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 1,675 - 2,165 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Granular formulations must be stored in a cool, dry location out of sunlight. Do not freeze Avadex EC formulation.

Avenza is not intended to be used without the addition of MCPA Ester 600. Add at the rate of 187 mL/acre for volunteer canola and lamb’s-quarter control. Use 234 mL/acre MCPA for all other weeds. MCPA Ester 600 is not included in the Avenza package and must be purchased separately.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

For optimum control, apply Avenza herbicide to actively growing weeds. Weed control may be reduced if applied under stress conditions or on wet foliage and/or heavy weed pressure. Optimum weed control will be obtained if application of Avenza herbicide is delayed until the stress conditions have ended and weeds are once again actively growing. Warm, moist growing conditions promote active weed growth and enhance the activity of Avenza by allowing maximum foliar uptake and activity.   

## How it works   

Avenza A contains Group 2 and 4 mode of action broadleaf herbicides. The Group 2 mode of action inhibits the production of ALS enzyme in the plant. This enzyme is essential to produce amino acids required for plant growth. The Group 4 mode of action disrupts normal plant growth regulation resulting in the death of susceptible plants. Avenza B herbicide contains a Group 1 mode of action that is absorbed by the leaves and rapidly translocated to the growing points of the leaves and stems. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed and re-growth may occur.   

## Expected results   

Actively growing susceptible grasses stop growing within 48 hours of treatment. Depending on several factors, leaves and growing points turn yellow within 1 to 3 weeks after application, followed by browning and control  3 to 5 weeks after application. Growth of susceptible broadleaf weeds stops rapidly. Symptoms may not be noticeable for 1 to 2 weeks depending on environment and species treated. Symptoms on broadleaf weeds include twisting, bending and yellowing; weeds will turn brown, resulting in plant mortality.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast within 1 hour of application. Grazing: Do not graze for 7 days or silage for 30 days following application. Pre-Harvest interval: Do not harvest the treated crop for grain within 60 days of application.   

Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Avenza herbicide can be seeded the following year to alfalfa, barley, canola, corn, dry common beans, faba bean, flax, lentils, mustard (brown, oriental, and/or yellow), oats, pea,  potato (except seed potato), soybean, sunflower, wheat or field can be summerfallowed.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## How it works   

Aviator II is readily absorbed by weed foliage. The Rumour component inhibits the ALS enzyme in plants resulting in a rapid halt in plant growth followed by yellowing, most noticeable after 1 to 2 weeks. The fluroxypyr and dicamba mimic plant growth regulators causing swelling, thickening and twisted weed growth followed by yellowing and browning, resulting in plant mortality.

Note: Nufarm also supports Epic mixed with Enforcer M.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application.   

Water volume: Ground – 20 - 40 L/acre minimum. Aerial – 12.1 L/acre minimum.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instruction “c” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

For optimum control, apply to actively growing weeds, ideally at the 2 to 3 leaf stage. An early application will maximize crop yields by reducing weed competition. Weeds emerging after application of Axial herbicide will not be controlled. Weed control following application of Axial herbicide alone, or in combination with broadleaf weed herbicides, can be reduced or delayed under stress conditions such as drought, heat, insufficient fertility, flooding or prolonged cool temperatures. Do not apply to crop that is stressed as crop injury may result.   

## How it works   

Herbicide is absorbed by the leaves and is rapidly translocated to the growing points of leaves and stems. Thorough coverage of the plants is essential for consistent control.   

## Expected results   

Actively growing susceptible grasses stop growing within 48 hours of treatment. Depending on species, growing conditions and crop competition, leaves and growing points turn yellow within 1 to 3 weeks after application.

Further colour changes and loss of vigour will be observed, followed by browning and control 3 to 5 weeks after application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast in 1 hour. Grazing: Observe a minimum of 7 days before grazing livestock treated fields.   

Pre-harvest interval: 60 days after treatment for grain and straw and 30 days after treatment for hay.

Axial Xtreme is absorbed by the leaves and is rapidly translocated to the growing points of leaves and stems, affecting both exposed and underground plant tissue. Thorough coverage of the plants is essential for consistent control.   

## Expected results   

Actively growing susceptible grasses stop growing within 48 hours of treatment. Depending on species, growing conditions and crop competition, leaves and growing points turn yellow within 1 to 3 weeks after application. Further colour changes and loss of vigour will be observed, followed by browning and control 3 to 5 weeks after application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Axial Xtreme herbicide alone can be used 1 hour before rainfall. Grazing: Observe a minimum of  7 days before grazing livestock on crops treated with Axial Xtreme herbicide. Pre-harvest intervals: 60 days after treatment for grain and straw and 30 days after treatment for hay. Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Axial Xtreme can be seeded the following year to barley, canola, flax, forage grasses, lentil, mustard, oats, pea, rye or wheat. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre   

## Application tips   

For optimal control, apply Axial Xtreme iPak herbicide to actively growing weeds, ideally at the 2 - 3 leaf stage. Weeds emerging after application of Axial Xtreme iPak herbicide will not be controlled. Weed control following application of Axial Xtreme iPak can be reduced or delayed under stress conditions such as drought, heat,  insufficient fertility, flooding or prolonged cool temperatures.   

Grassy weeds may regrow under stress conditions. Optimum weed control will be obtained if application of Axial Xtreme iPak is delayed until the stress conditions have ended and weeds are once again actively growing. Do not apply to crop that is stressed by conditions such as frost, low fertility, flooding, disease or insect damage as crop injury may result.   

## How it works   

Axial Xtreme is absorbed by the leaves and is rapidly translocated to the growing points of the leaves and stems, affecting both exposed and underground plant tissue. Thorough coverage of plants is essential for consistent  control so higher water volumes are advised.   

Pyrasulfotole is absorbed through leaves and is translocated to meristematic regions where it inhibits the HPPD enzyme. Pyrasulfotole inhibits plant pigment biosynthesis and photosynthesis.

## Barricade II/Foxxy R/Foxxy RCK/Audible (cont’d)   

## Application tips   

Higher spray volumes needed with a dense crop canopy and/or large weeds. Weeds should be less than 10 cm tall or across at application. Barricade/Rumour left in the tank for more than 24 hours might have reduced effectiveness. When crop is under stress, application may result in crop injury such as temporary crop colour lightening or a slight height reduction. Clean sprayer immediately after application and use ammonia.   

Note: Activity is influenced by weather conditions. Optimum activity requires active crop and weed growth. The temperature range for optimum activity is 12   

°   

C to 24   

°   

C.  Reduced activity will occur when temperatures are below 8   

°   

C or above 27   

°   

C. Frost before application (3 days) or shortly after (3 days) may reduce weed control and crop tolerance. Weed control may be reduced during stress conditions, for example drought, heat or cold stress, or if weeds have initiated flowering, or if heavy infestations exist.   

## How it works   

Absorbed through foliage. Inhibits cell elongation. Causes stem elongation, leaf cupping or curling.   

## Expected results   

Growth stops immediately. Discolouration of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed species. Poor results may be expected if there is improper mixing, timing, coverage or when weeds are under drought stress.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour of application may reduce weed control. Grazing: May not be grazed or fed to livestock within 7 days of application. Pre-harvest intervals: Allow 60 days between application and harvest.   

Re-cropping: Barley, canola, flax, forage grasses, lentil, alfalfa, field corn, dry bean, faba bean, potato, soybean, sugar beet, sunflower, mustard, oats, pea, rye, forage grasses or wheat can be seeded the following year after application, or field can be summerfallowed. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

For ground application, use a 15-metre buffer between sprayed area and sensitive habitat. Use 100-metre buffer for rotary wing aircraft, 125-metre for fixed wing. Do not contaminate water when cleaning equipment.

## Application information   

How to apply: Basagran/Benta Super/Boa/Broadloom: Ground and aerial application (soybeans and dry beans aerial application only). Basagran Forte can only be applied by ground equipment. Water volume: Ground: 40 -  160 L/acre. Aerial: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Do not apply to crops that have been stressed as crop injury may result. Best results are when weeds are young  and actively growing. Apply Basagran/Benta Super/Boa to stork’s-bill at the 2 to 6 leaf stage and to cleavers at the  1 to 3 whorl stage.   

## How it works   

Contact herbicide that interferes with photosynthesis. In resistant plants, bentazon metabolizes to a non-toxic material. Uptake into the plant occurs primarily through the leaves. Thorough coverage of foliage is important for consistent weed control.

## Expected results   

Weeds: Weeds turn yellow initially and then brown, usually within 2 weeks. Crops: Yellowing, bronzing, speckling or burning occurs sometimes. The crop usually outgrows the condition within 10 days. Poor results may be expected when weeds are beyond recommended growth stage, when spray coverage is poor or under poor growing conditions (cool weather conditions or drought).   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 6 to 8 hours of application may reduce activity. Grazing: Do not graze treated fields or cut treated forage for silage or hay; sufficient data are not available to support such use. Basagran Forte: Do not apply within 30 days of harvest for forage sorghum and forage millet. Do not graze treated alfalfa or cut for hay within 20 days of application. Re-cropping: No restrictions the year after treatment. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Pre-harvest intervals: 25 days for all products except for Basagran Forte, which has the following restrictions: Forage sorghum/millet – 30 days. Grain sorghum/millet – 30 days. Red clover (seed production) – 36 days.   

## Environmental precautions   

Basagran/Basagran Forte/Benta Super/Boa is toxic to aquatic organisms, including fish. Do not apply this product directly or contaminate aquatic habitats or water sources. Leaching: The use of bentazon may result in contamination of groundwater, particularly in areas where soils are permeable. Drift: Avoid drift into non-target areas.   

## Toxicity

## Registered tank mixes   

NewAgco Inc. supports the following non-registered tank mixes. Deathstar ll: Himalaya, Axial, Simplicity/Simplicity GoDRI , Hellcat, Clobber M, Lontrel, MCPA Ester 600. Use the most restrictive use limitations for either product. Consult grass mixes for registrations.Battlestar: Himalaya, Axial, Simplicity.   

## Application information   

Water volume: Ground application only. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Half fill sprayer with water and agitate. If mixing with a WDG or dry formulation, add the dry formulation to the mixture first. Add Battlefront, followed by Foxxy and MCPA, followed by the grassy herbicide tank mix partner.   

## How it works   

Battlestar/Deathstar ll are readily absorbed by weed foliage. The florasulam component inhibits the ALS enzyme in plants resulting in a rapid halt in plant growth followed by yellowing, most noticeable after 1 to 2 weeks. Fluroxypyr mimics plant growth regulators causing swelling and thickening and twisted weed growth followed by yellowing and browning, resulting in plant mortality.   

## Expected results   

Weeds start to discolour and twist usually within 1 to 2 weeks after application. Plant growth will cease or become erratic followed by browning and plant mortality. Complete death will take 1 to 3 weeks depending on weed size and environmental conditions.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 2 hours after application may reduce efficacy. Grazing: Do not cut the treated crop for hay or graze treated crop within 7 days after application. Re-cropping: Grow all major crops the year after application.   

Pre-harvest intervals: Mature crop may be harvested 60 days after application.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

This product has the potential to leach. Do not apply excessive irrigation. Use a buffer zone of 30 metres between area applied and sensitive terrestrial and aquatic habitats.

## How it works   

Contact only. Pelargonic acid moves through the cuticle and cell membranes lowering the internal PH of plant cells causing collapse and desiccation of plant tissue.   

## Expected results   

Fast-acting burndown herbicide. It will only burn those plant parts that are coated with the spray solution. The degree of burndown and longevity of control are less when the plants are inactive, mature, or biennial/perennial types. Repeat applications may be required to achieve desired weed control and for foliage desiccation and weed management prior to harvest in wheat, barley, oats and potatoes..   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: No rainfast period is specified on the label; required interval may be up to 8 hours. Contact manufacturer for more information. Grazing: Not specified on label. Re-cropping: Not specified on label.   

Pre-harvest interval: 1 day. Re-entry interval: Do not enter until spray has dried.   

## Environmental precautions   

Avoid spraying in situation where drift may occur. Leave a buffer zone of at least 1m for protection of terrestrial habitats.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 - 80 L/acre for Betamix β.   

## Application tips   

Avoid spraying until mid-afternoon when daytime temperatures will exceed 22°C. High humidity increases efficacy. Best results are obtained with repeat applications of the lowest rate commencing when the first weeds emerge.  Do not apply during periods of dead calm. Avoid application when winds are gusty.   

## How it works   

Absorbed through leaves. Sharply inhibits rate of assimilation of CO2   

in treated plants within 6 hours.  Resistant species (sugar beets) begin recovery in this time while susceptible species do not.   

## Expected results   

Under warm conditions, weed kill is complete in 4 to 7 days. Cool conditions require longer periods of up to 2 weeks.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 6 hours of application may reduce weed kill. Grazing: Do not graze treated crops or use  for livestock feed; sufficient data are not available to support such use. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not apply to  sugar beet later than 60 days prior to harvest. Recropping: Recropping restrictions not specified on the label.   

Re-entry interval: 24 hours.

## Application information   

Apply with ground equipment only. Water volume: Minimum 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Good growing conditions promote weed growth and enhance the activity of BlackHawk. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be controlled. Insufficient water volumes or coarse sprays may also reduce control levels.   

## How it works   

BlackHawk Herbicide is designed for use as a contact and systemic herbicide for broadleaf weed control. Pyraflufen-ethyl, a member of the phenyl pyrazole class of herbicides, inhibits the protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) enzyme, which results in cell membrane destruction and necrosis. 2,4-D ester, a member of the phenoxy class of herbicides, mimics the plant growth regulator indol-3-acetic acid (auxin), interfering with cell enlargement and division as well as development in susceptible plants.   

## Expected results   

Symptoms appear very rapidly (a few hours under bright conditions). Leaves of weeds take on a water-soaked appearance, followed by wilting and necrosis. Susceptible plants become malformed before they die. Complete death occurs within a few days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast in 1 hour. Grazing: Do not permit lactating dairy animals to graze fields within 7 days after application. Do not harvest or cut treated crops for forage until 30 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter. Re-cropping: All crops can be seeded 30 days after an application of Blackhawk herbicide. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Runoff: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast or to areas with steep slopes and/or compacted clay soils.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 565. Acute dermal LD50   

(rats) = > 2000 mg/kg   

## Storage   

Storage below 0°C will not impair the effectiveness of BlackHawk herbicide; however, if frozen, return to original state but allowing to warm to 10 to 20°C and agitate thoroughly before use.

Note: Weeds must be small and actively growing to be controlled. 1 Group 2 resistant grassy weeds will not be controlled.   

## Application information   

Water volume: Minimum 10 gallons/acre (40 L/acre).   

## Application tips   

Optimal control occurs when weeds are actively growing. Do not apply to crops that have been stressed as crop injury may result. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## How it works   

Bentazon component is a contact herbicide that interferes with photosynthesis, Quizalofop component is a systemic herbicide that is absorbed and translocates to the root system and growing points.   

## Expected results   

Weeds initially discolour and turn brown within several weeks, depending on conditions.Temperatures below 5°C  will prevent optimum herbicide performance. Poor broadleaf control can occur if weeds are past the 4-leaf stage or  if spray coverage and/or crop competition is poor.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

For optimum results, apply Broadband herbicide to actively growing weeds. Weeds emerging after application of Broadband will not be controlled. Do not apply to crops stressed by conditions such as frost, low fertility, drought, flooding, disease or insect damage as crop injury may result.   

## How it works   

Broadband herbicide is absorbed by the leaves and is rapidly translocated to the growing points of leaves and stems of target weeds. It must be applied early post emergence to the main flush of actively growing annual broadleaf and grass weeds. Thorough coverage of the plants is essential for consistent control.   

## Expected results   

Broadband is a systemic, post-emergence herbicide. Broadband herbicide stops growth of susceptible weeds rapidly. Actively growing, susceptible grass and broadleaf weeds stop growing within 48 hours of treatment.  However, typical symptoms (discolouration) of dying broadleaf weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 2 weeks after application. Depending on species, growing conditions and crop competition, leaves and growing points of annual grass weeds turn yellow within 1 to 3 weeks after application. Further colour changes and loss of vigour will be observed, followed by a browning and control 3 to 5 weeks after application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Broadband alone can be used 1 hour before rainfall. Grazing: Wait a minimum of 7 days before grazing livestock on treated crops. Pre-harvest intervals: Observe minimum interval to harvest of 60 days after treatment for grain and straw and of 30 days after treatment for hay. Re-cropping: On fields sprayed with Broadband, no crop may be seeded until the following year. There are no crop rotation limitations the year following application of Broadband.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

The active ingredient, pinoxaden, is non-toxic to birds and insects (bees) and slightly toxic to aquatic organisms. The active ingredient, florasulam, is practically non-toxic to insects (bees), aquatic invertebrates (water flea), fish, and is non-toxic to slightly toxic to birds. Avoid contamination of water supplies or aquatic habitats.

## Application Information   

How to apply: Ground and air (for wheat, barley and oats only). Water volume: Ground – 20 L/acre or more.  Corn – 80 - 120 L/acre. Seedling grasses – 60 L/acre. Established timothy – 60 L/acre. Air – 8 L/acre or more.   

## Application tips   

Avoid spraying during a severe drought. Under conditions of high temperature and humidity, slight discolouration  of cereals may occur but no effect on crop yields. Flax is less tolerant than cereals. Therefore, do not spray flax in  hot, humid weather when daytime temperatures are over 25 to 29°C. Best results are achieved when weeds are  sprayed in seedling stage, with good spray coverage.   

## How it works   

Bromoxynil is a contact type herbicide; therefore, good spray coverage is essential. Inhibits photosynthesis and  plant respiration. MCPA is absorbed through leaves and is readily translocated in the plant.   

## Expected results   

Small burnt spots on the leaf can appear within hours; death takes up to 2 weeks. Poor results may be expected if poor coverage. Poor penetration through dense crop canopy.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour of application may reduce weed control. Grazing: Do not graze or harvest for greenfeed until 30 days after treatment. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not cut treated crops for forage until 30 days after application. Re-cropping: No restrictions. Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Buctril M/Badge/Logic M contains a petroleum distillate, which is moderately to highly toxic to aquatic organisms. Observe buffer zones specified on the label under directions for use.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50

## Registered tank mixes   

Aatrex Liquid 480.   

## Application information   

How to Apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre   

## Mixing instructions   

The tank-mix order is Callisto, Aatrex Liquid 480 and then non-ionic surfactant. If glyphosate is tank mixed, add last.   

## Application tips   

Apply post-emergent on irrigated corn in southern Alberta. Callisto must be applied with Aatrex Liquid 480 and a non-ionic surfactant. The registered rate of Aatrex Liquid 480 when mixed with Callisto is 250 mL/ac minimum. 400 mL/ac of Aatrex Liquid 480 is recommended for large annual broadleaf weeds. The registered rate of non-ionic surfactant is 0.20% v/v. Callisto and Aatrex Liquid 480 may be mixed with specific glyphosate formulations. All weeds on the glyphosate label are controlled when combined with glyphosate, including glyphosate-resistant biotypes. If agitation is stopped for more than 5 minutes, re-suspend the spray solution by running on full agitation before spraying. Callisto 480SC must be sprayed the same day as mixing.   

Weed control following the application of Callisto Herbicide in a tank mix with Aatrex Liquid 480 can be reduced or delayed under stress conditions such as drought, heat, low fertility, flooding or prolonged cool temperatures. Optimum weed control will be obtained if the application of Callisto in a tank mix with Aatrex Liquid 480 is delayed until the stress conditions have ended and weeds are again actively growing.   

## How it works   

Callisto works by inhibiting photosynthesis in weeds, which ultimately leads to their death. Specifically, Callisto targets a plant enzyme called HPPD (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase), which is essential to produce carotenoids, pigments necessary for photosynthesis in plants. When this enzyme is inhibited, the weeds cannot produce enough carotenoids and photosynthesis is disrupted, causing the weed to die.   

## Expected results   

Weed competition is quickly halted and visual symptoms of dying weeds (discolouration) may take up to 2 weeks to appear, depending on the weed species and growing conditions. Generally, the weeds will show visual symptoms of herbicide damage within a few days of application, including leaf discoloration, stunted growth and chlorosis.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast in 3 hours. Grazing: Consult the label of the product(s) tank mixed with Callisto for specific instructions regarding additional grazing restrictions. Re-cropping: When mixed with Aatrex 480 herbicide at less than 400 mL/acre: canola, spring wheat, oats and barley – 10 months. Field peas, soybeans, sugar beets and potatoes – 11 months. In the event of crop failure, only field corn (grain or silage), seed corn or sweet corn can be planted as a salvage crop in the same fields in which the failed crop was treated with Callisto. Total precipitation, including irrigation, during the year (April to September) year of application must be equal or greater than 275 mm on irrigated land. Consult the label of the product(s) tank mixed with Callisto for specific instructions regarding additional re-cropping restrictions. Pre-harvest Intervals: 100 days for field corn for grain. 45 days for field corn for forage, including silage. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Observe labelled spray buffer zones. Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast.

## Application information   

Casoron can be spread on the soil surface by hand, using small hand-held or backpack equipment, or by larger and tractor-mounted spreaders. Do not apply by air.   

## Application tips   

Do not apply until 4 weeks after transplanting any crop. Casoron should be applied when the soil temperature is cool. Air temperatures should be less than 15°C. Applying at higher temperatures may reduce its herbicidal activity. Casoron will stay in the upper 10 cm of soil and will not harm established plants with a well developed root system below this herbicide barrier. Do not use in seedbeds, transplant, or cutting beds or in greenhouses. Do not apply until 6 months after rooting of cuttings in the field.   

## How it works   

Casoron inhibits cell growth at the growing points or meristematic tissues of the plant. Weed germination and growth initiation are strongly affected. Water is necessary to move the compound into the soil. Snowmelt or rain after the application moves Casoron into the soil. Casoron inhibits germination but acts primarily on growing points and root tips.   

## Expected results   

Growth of emerging shoots of some perennials controlled. Tolerant crops are unaffected if roots do not come in contact with Casoron in the upper layers of the soil.   

## Restrictions   

Grazing: Do not graze livestock in treated areas or use treated crops for forage or fodder; sufficient data are not available to support such use. Re-cropping: Do not plant vegetables or other sensitive crops the year following soil treatment. Re-entry interval: Agricultural crops – 12 hours. Horticulture/nursery crops – 24 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Casoron is toxic to aquatic organisms and slightly toxic to fish. Avoid contamination of aquatic systems during application.   

## Toxicity

## Registered tank mixes   

Certitude must be tank mixed with glyphosate at 0.5 - 1 L/acre of 360 g/L equivalent.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing Instructions   

Add products to the spray tank in the following order: Certitude A, Certitude B, Glyphosate, Merge.   

## Application Tips   

Do not spray if temperatures of 5   

0   

C or lower are forecast within 3 days of application. Apply during warm weather when weeds are actively growing and soil moisture is adequate for rapid growth. Under cool or dry conditions, control of some weeds may be reduced.   

## How it works   

Topramezone is absorbed through foliage and is translocated to the meristematic regions. It inhibits the HPPD enzyme causing bleaching of leaves. Bromoxynil inhibits respiration and photosynthesis causing plant death.   

## Expected results   

Rapid bleaching and necrosis of leaves within days. Plant death will occur up to 14 days after application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour will reduce control. Grazing: Do not feed treated canola grain to livestock.   

Re-cropping: Winter wheat can be seeded 4 months after application. Alfalfa, barley, canola, field corn, field pea, lentils, navy (white) bean, potato, soybean, spring wheat (including durum) can be seeded 1 year after application.   

Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Avoid spraying in situations where drift may occur. Bromoxynil is moderately to highly toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Avoid contamination of aquatic systems during application.   

## Toxicity   

Topramezone: Acute oral LD50

Corteva Agriscience supports Cirpreme XC with Axial Xtreme. If adding MCPA Ester 600, do not exceed 189 mL/acre. Apply according to the most restrictive use limitation for either product.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

Apply when weeds are actively growing. Only weeds emerged at the time of treatment will be controlled. Best results are obtained from applications made to seedling weeds. Read and observe all label directions when applied as a tank mix combination. Cirpreme is a selective post-emergent herbicide for control of hard-to-kill annual broadleaf weeds and selected perennial weeds. Warm, moist growing conditions promote active weed growth and enhance the activity of Cirpreme by allowing for maximum foliar uptake and systemic movement of the herbicide.   

## How it works   

Cirpreme is a mixture of a systemic auxin herbicide (Group 4) and an ALS enzyme inhibitor herbicide (Group 2). The product controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns and/or by inhibiting the production of the enzymes essential for the production of certain amino acids for plant growth.   

## Expected results   

Weeds start to twist between 2 to 20 days after spraying, depending on weather conditions, rate of growth, moisture and the weeds being targeted by this herbicide application. Symptoms include twisting, bending and yellowing, with weeds turning brown, resulting in plant mortality.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application if rainfall is forecast with 4 hours. Grazing: Livestock may be grazed on treated crops  7 days following application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop for 60 days after application. Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Cirpreme after a period of 10 months can be seeded to wheat, spring barley, canola, flax, mustard, field pea*, or fields can be summerfallowed. *Field pea is at risk of injury under severe dry conditions (<175 mm of rain over year). Do not seed to crops other than those listed above in the calendar year following treatment. Consult manufacturer for rotations on crops not listed.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

A 1 metre buffer zone is required between treated area, terrestrial and water habits. Do not allow spray drift to come in contact with sensitive broadleaf crops. Spray when the wind velocity is 15 km/hr or less.

## Application tips   

Should be applied to actively growing weeds. An early application will maximize crop yields by reducing weed competition. Thorough coverage of the plants is essential for consistent control. Do not apply to crop that is stressed by conditions such as frost, low fertility, drought, flooding, disease or insect damage as crop injury may result.   

## How it works   

Cirray Herbicide is a systemic, post-emergence herbicide which is absorbed by the leaves and is rapidly translocated to the growing points of leaves and stems.   

## Expected results   

Actively growing susceptible grasses stop growing within 48 hours of treatment. Depending on species, growing conditions and crop competition, leaves and growing points turn yellow within one to three weeks after application. Further colour changes and loss of vigour will be observed, followed by a browning and control three to five weeks after application. Weeds emerging after application will not be controlled. Weed control can be reduced or delayed under stress conditions such as drought, heat, or insufficient fertility, flooding, or prolonged cool temperatures. Grass escapes or re-tillering may occur if application is made during prolonged stress conditions. Optimum weed control will be obtained if application is delayed until the stress conditions have ended and weeds are once again actively growing.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast in 1 hour. Grazing: Observe a minimum of 30 days before grazing livestock. Re-cropping: There are no crop rotation limitations the year following application. Pre-harvest Intervals: 65 days. Re-entry interval:   

12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to non-target terrestrial plants and aquatic organisms. Observe spray buffer zones on label. Minimize spray drift to reduce harmful effects on beneficial arthropods in habitats next to application site such as hedgerows and woodland. Avoid runoff risk under conditions of heavy rainfall, moderate to steep slope, bare soil, poorly draining soil. The use of this chemical may result in groundwater contamination, particularly in areas where soils are permeable  and/or the depth to the water table is shallow. Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast.

## Application tips   

Apply Clever/ngenious/Facet L when weeds are small and actively growing. Early treatment of weeds with Clever/Ingenious/Facet L is important to maximize crop yield potential through elimination of early weed competition. Some initial crop injury may be observed after application, but this injury is usually outgrown and should not affect crop yield   

## How it works   

Uptake into the plant occurs through both the foliage and root system as the herbicide is mainly systemic. Visual symptoms of weed control may take up to 2 weeks following application to develop. These symptoms include initial twisting to stunting, reddening and chlorosis about 14 days followed by necrosis and death about 21 days after application as characteristic auxin-like symptoms in broadleaf species.   

## Expected results   

Do not apply to crop that is under stress from conditions such as frost, hail, flooding, drought or extremes in temperature. Cool weather or drought may delay weed control and if prolonged may result in poor weed control.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 6 hours may reduce control. Do not apply Clever/Ingenious/Facet L to any field more often than every second year. This practice must be respected to avoid potential injury to future rotational crops, to minimize the potential for carryover and accumulation of soil residues and to reduce the selection pressure that could contribute to the development of resistant biotypes. Pre-harvest intervals: Pre-harvest canola and Group 2 tolerant canola quality Brassica juncea and tame mustard (brown and oriental) 60 days. Pre-harvest wheat, canaryseed and durum – 77 days. Barley – 80 days. Grazing: Do not graze treated crop or cut for hay within 77 days of application.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Re-cropping: Barley, canola and wheat, including durum, can be re-planted in the same season as quinclorac is used. Oat (Facet L only), field pea, sunflower, flax and lentil – 10-month re-cropping interval and may be grown the year after application. Oat (Clever, Quiclorac, Ingenious) – 12-month re-cropping interval. On lighter soils with low organic matter or under dry conditions, some crop injury may occur, particularly in flax and lentil, but will not reduce yield. Under these conditions, the minimum re-cropping interval for flax and lentil should be extended by 22 months. In case of crop failure, only barley, canola or spring wheat (including durum) may be re-seeded the same year. The company recommends that a field bioassay be conducted the year before growing any crops other than those listed.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not apply quinclorac when weather conditions may cause spray drift from treated areas to adjacent crops.  Certain crops such as alfalfa, clover species, faba bean, flax, lentil, ornamentals, potato and vegetables will  be injured by spray drift.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions:   

Use mixing instructions "a" on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Temporary whitening and/or yellowing of the crop may occur when it emerges from treated soil. Do not make more than 1 application per season. Apply prior to seeding canola. Do not apply to sandy soils, soils with greater than 10% organic matter or fields receiving applications of solid manure unless it has been throughly incorporated to a depth of 10 - 15 cm. Do not exceed label recommended rates. Avoid overlaps or excessive application, which could cause crop and/or rotational injury. It is essential to get good plant coverage with Command Charge B. Command 360ME and Command Charge can only be applied once in a growing season   

## How it works   

Clomazone is absorbed by roots and emerging shoots and transported in the xylem to foliage. It interferes with a specific energy pathway in the synthesis of chlorophyll. For Command Charge, the Command Charge B is rapidly absorbed by foliage and inhibits the PPO enzyme, which is involved in chlorophyll and heme synthesis. Cell membranes leak and rapid browning and death occurs.   

## Expected results   

Moisture is necessary to activate the active ingredient clomazone in soil for weed control. Temporary whitening and/or yellowing of the crop may occur when it emerges from the treated soil.

Carryover injury to rotational crops can occur under the following circumstances: exceeding label rates, over-application, soil with pH< or = 5.9, extreme dryness or drought conditions or choice of rotational crop hybrid. Do not apply when temperatures exceed 25   

0   

C due to vapour drift risk. Rainfall: 5 to 10 mm of moisture is required at one time within 7 to 10 days for activation of herbicide for weed control in soil. Heavy rains after application may dilute active herbicide layer and reduce weed control. Dry conditions after application may reduce control. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crop or cut for feed. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Runoff: Low mobility in soils. Leaching: Leaching is not a problem. Broken down by soil bacteria. Use 90-metre buffers between sprayed area and sensitive terrestrial habitats. Do not spray within 370 metres of residential areas of towns/subdivisions or areas of established vegetable production, fruit production, commercial nurseries or greenhouses.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Conquer II is a contact type herbicide. Good coverage is essential for performance.   

## How it works   

Conquer II is primarily a contact herbicide with no residual. As such, good coverage is essential for activity. Conquer II works on 2 separate pathways within broadleaf weed species, photosystem II and the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway. Conquer II contains 2 separate modes of action that work by inhibiting the movement of electrons in photosystem II and halting the production of chlorophyll. Both modes of action result in the generation of singlet oxygen, which causes the oxidation of cell membranes. This outcome results in fast chlorosis and death of affected plant tissue.   

## Expected results   

Susceptible weeds will develop water-soaked lesions within hours of application. Tissue will turn chlorotic then necrotic. Necrotic tissue will become dry and crispy. Good growing conditions and sunlight will increase the speed and overall level of control.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Product is rainfast in 1 hour. Grazing: Do not graze treated fields or cut for livestock feed for 30 days after application. Re-cropping: Labelled crops can be seeded immediately after application. Any crops not listed can be seeded 30 days after an application of Conquer II. Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

This product is toxic to aquatic organisms, small wild mammals and birds, certain insects and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zones found on the Conquer II label. Runoff, leaching: Observe buffer zones found on the Conquer II label.

## Application tips   

When weeds are under extreme drought stress or showing effects of excessive moisture, control can be reduced or delayed. Weed escapes may occur under prolonged stress conditions or low fertility. Do not apply to weeds stressed for more than 20 days due to lack of moisture as unsatisfactory control can result. Ensure uniform spray coverage over the entire area of target weeds.   

## How it works   

Clopyralid is a growth regulator type of herbicide. It is primarily absorbed through the foliage and is translocated to all parts of the plant causing leaf and stem twisting and yellowing and then death. MCPA is a systemic herbicide for broadleaf weeds, which is translocated throughout the plant causing rapid undifferentiated growth, which usually results in the death of susceptible weeds.   

## Expected results   

Weeds start to twist after spraying; then, plants turn brown and die. Difficult to control weeds such as Canada thistle and wild buckwheat stop growing, change colour to dark green and then turn yellow before they die. Death may not occur for 14 to 21 days after application. Some weak Canada thistle regrowth may occur by end of season.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if rain is expected in 6 hours. Grazing: Do not cut or graze treated fields of wheat, barley, oats or flax within 7 days after application. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest wheat, barley, oats or flax within 60 days after application or within 7 days after application when harvesting for forage. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter. Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Curtail M herbicide can be seeded to wheat, barley, oats and rye (not under-seeded to forage legumes), canola, corn, field peas, flax, forage grasses, mustard, sugar beets or can be summer-fallowed in the following year. Do not seed to field peas for at least 10 months following treatment.  Very dry soil conditions following application can result in a risk of injury to field pea grown in rotation. If severe drought conditions are experienced during the months of June to August inclusive in the year of application, delay seeding field peas an additional 12 months (total 22 months following application). Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Curtail M contains a petroleum distillate that is moderately to highly toxic to aquatic organisms. Avoid contamination of aquatic systems during application and cleanup. Observe buffer zones specified under directions for use on  the label.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water Volume: Ground: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Fill the tank ½ full of water and start agitation. Add the required amount of Himalaya and agitate until fully dissolved. Add the required amount of Foxxy, then Clobber M. Add the required amount of surfactant, fill tank with remaining water.   

## Application tips   

When spraying under the conditions of waterlogged or saturated soils, temperature extremes, drought, low fertility or plant disease, wheat can show unacceptable injury symptoms. Weed control may also be reduced by these same conditions. Optimum weed control occurs at 12 - 24   

0   

C. Reduced activity will occur when temperatures are below 8   

0   

C or above 27   

0   

C. Frost before application (3 days) or shortly after (3 days) may reduce weed control and crop tolerance.   

## How it works   

On broadleaf weeds, the components move within the plant to control exposed and underground plant tissue. The herbicide mimics naturally occurring plant hormones and controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms include twisting of stems and swollen nodes. On grass weeds, flucarbazone is a systemic herbicide that is absorbed by both leaves and roots and moves rapidly to the growing point of the plant.   

## Expected results   

Growth of susceptible plants stops soon after application. Symptoms on grasses include discolouration (yellowing, reddening, and purpling), and complete control may take 2 weeks. Broadleaf weeds start to twist shortly after being sprayed. After twisting and bending, plants stop growing, turn brown, and die.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 4 hours of application may reduce efficacy. Grazing: Do not graze treated fields or use green crop for feed. Wheat grain or straw from harvested treated fields may be fed to livestock.   

Pre-harvest Intervals: Mature crop may be harvested 80 days after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Registered tank mixes   

Distinct should always be tank mixed with glyphosate 0.5 - 1 L/acre of 360 g/l equivalent for chemfallow and post-harvest applications. Merge (200 mL/acre) is always required regardless of the glyphosate formulation used. In field corn, if Distinct is applied alone, should use 1.25% non-ionic surfactant + 1.25 of 28% UAN. Do not use either UAN or a non-ionic surfactant if mixed with glyphosate.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground equipment only. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre. Use higher water volume (40 L/acre) for dense weed stands or larger weeds and if applying on glyphosate resistant kochia.   

## Application tips   

Good growing conditions promote weed growth and enhance the activity of Distinct. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be controlled. Insufficient water volumes or coarse sprays may also reduce control levels.   

## How it works   

Absorbed through roots and leaves and translocated in phloem and xylem causing a disruption in cell metabolism.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 4 hours of application may reduce activity. Grazing: Do not graze treated fields for 75 days after corn application. Pre-harvest interval: Do not harvest grain within 120 days of application.   

Re-cropping: Apply only the low rate between September 1 to 30 to re-crop to canola, lentil, field pea, soybean or cereal crop the following spring. Applications at a higher rate after September 1 can only re-crop to cereals the followoing spring. Contact maunufacturer for a full list of approved crops the followingseason for all use pattern and rates. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application information   

How to apply: Apply with ground equipment: band or overall spray. Water volume: 60 L/acre minimum.   

Incorporation: Incorporate to 5 cm if using power driven cultivator or Mulch Master. Do not exceed this depth since product dilution can occur. If using tandem discs, set to cut to a depth of 10 cm operated at 6 to 9 km/h. If using vibrating shank cultivators with overlapping sweeps, set 10 cm deep and operate at 10 to 13 km/h. Spike tooth or diamond tooth harrows are good incorporation equipment. Immediate incorporation is not necessary although desirable.   

## Application tips   

For band treatments, use a press wheel ahead of the nozzle to level the band.   

## How it works   

Inhibits germination, particularly grasses.   

## Expected results   

Annual grasses do not germinate or under dry conditions, may die back soon after emergence.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Moisture required to move chemical to area of germination but an excess may move it below this area.   

Grazing: Do not graze treated immature crops or cut for hay. Sufficient data are not available to support such use. In the case of corn, immature means before ear emergence. Pre-harvest interval: Corn – 80 days. Sweet corn – 45 days (Dual ll), 80 days (Komodo). Asparagus – 16 days. Sugar beet – 120 days. Re-cropping: Winter cereals 4.5 months after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application information   

How to apply: Apply with ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Note: Do not use galvanized steel or  unlined steel tanks as a combustible gas may be formed. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Ensure that the crop has not advanced beyond the recommended leaf stage for application. Treat crops during warm weather when weeds are actively growing. Best results are obtained when Canada thistle is actively growing and soil moisture is adequate for rapid growth. Do not treat weeds under poor growing conditions. Reduced results may occur when treating weeds heavily covered with dust. Reduced results may occur if water-containing soil is used, such as water from ponds and unlined ditches.   

## How it works   

Eclipse is readily absorbed by foliage and roots. Clopyralid is a systemic, hormone-type herbicide absorbed by leaf, stem surfaces and roots and translocated upwards and downward. Glyphosate is a non-selective, systemic herbicide that moves from the foliage into the roots and kills the entire plant. Maximum efficacy results from foliar application to young, actively growing plants.

## Expected results   

Under good growing conditions, wilting and yellowing of annuals occurs within 2 to 4 days. Herbicide symptoms on affected annual and perennial weeds may also include swollen growing points and roots, cupping of leaves, twisted and distorted stems and leaves. Cool or cloudy weather may slow activity. Affected weeds turn yellow before turning brown as they die. Death of weeds may not occur until 14 to 21 days after application. Browning of above ground growth and deterioration of roots occurs.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if rainfall is forecast for the time of application. Grazing: Allow 3 to 5 days before grazing treated areas. Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Eclipse can be seeded the following year to wheat, oats, barley, rye (not underseeded with legumes, clover or alfalfa), forage grasses, flax, canola, mustard, field pea, soybean, sugar beet or they can be summerfallowed. Seed only those crops listed above in the year following treatment. Do not seed to field peas for at least 10 months following treatment. Very dry soil conditions following application can result in a risk of injury to field peas grown in rotation. If severe drought conditions are experienced during the months of June to August inclusive in the year of application, delay seeding field pea an additional 12 months (total 22 months following application). Manure and straw: Residues of the herbicide tank mix occurring in the straw may be harmful to susceptible plants. Do not use straw or crop residue from treated crops for composting or mulching susceptible broadleaved crops. If the straw or crop residue is used for animal bedding or feed, return the manure to fields to be planted to clopyralid tolerant crops such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, forage grasses, canola or flax. Do not grow susceptible crops such as pea, bean, lentil, potato, sunflower or other sensitive crops on land that has been mulched with straw containing clopyralid residues within the last 12 months. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Avoid contamination of non-target land, water or irrigation ditches. Do not use Eclipse III tank mix where it can  enter water bodies.

## Application information   

Directions for use – direct-seeding systems: Direct seeding is defined as seed placement into standing stubble (including chemical fallow) with minimum soil disturbance and maximum surface residue retention. Edge for weed control in direct-seeding systems is intended for use on soils that have been in a low disturbance, direct-seeding system with < 30% soil disturbance for at least 2 consecutive years. In the year of seeding, a one pass, direct-seeding operation with minimal soil disturbance (<30%) is recommended. Edge applied to the soil surface provides long-lasting control of susceptible weeds within the top 2.5 cm of the soil surface Edge in direct-seeding systems is adsorbed to the soil surface and will not control weeds that germinate from a deeper depth (> 2.5 cm) or pre-emerged weeds.   

Land preparation – crop residue management: At harvest, chopping, spreading and even distribution of straw and chaff residues is an effective method of straw management. Poor crop residues may create plugging or hair pinning during the seeding operation. Poor and uneven crop emergence, cold wet soils, soil nutrient tie-up and delayed and uneven maturity may also be a result of inadequate trash management. Preseeding (burn off) weed control:   

A preseeding burn-off herbicide treatment is required to eliminate weed competition prior to crop emergence.   

Application instructions: Apply uniformly with a properly calibrated granular herbicide applicator. Avoid concentration of the herbicide in narrow bands. A single harrow operation assists in managing straw residue to ensure good herbicide soil contact. Avoid excessive soil disturbance.   

Seeding instructions: Use direct-seeding equipment seeding at a uniform depth to ensure seed-soil contact and  rapid crop emergence. Minimum soil disturbance ensures a uniform herbicide layer at the soil surface.   

Fall application: Edge for weed control in direct-seeding systems may be applied in the fall between October 1  and prior to soil freeze-up for weed control the following year. Apply Edge at the fall rates listed above using a harrow operation to manage crop residue and ensure herbicide soil contact.   

Spring application: Edge for weed control in direct-seeding systems may be applied in the spring. These applications should be made at the spring application rates listed above and applied as early as field conditions permit and at least 10 days prior to seeding. The shallow harrow incorporation should be performed within 24 hours of application.

## Application tips   

To avoid concentrating wild oats and volunteer cereal seeds below the treated layer, do not plow the land prior to  Edge application. Do not apply to fields spread with manure during the past 12 months.  Do not apply to soils subject to prolonged periods of flooding or soils in poor working condition. Edge MicroActiv can be used where trash is heavier or on standing weeds provided they do not interfere with distribution of the granules and do not limit incorporation. Do not apply on soils with less than 2% organic matter. Application on eroded knolls or Grey Wooded soils with highly variable texture and organic matter may result in a reduced crop stand, delayed development or reduced yield in either treated crop or rotational crop.   

## How it works   

A pre-emergence herbicide that kills seedlings as they germinate. Inhibits cell division in the actively growing points of the root and shoot. Does not control established weeds.   

## Expected results   

Weeds: Most die before emerging. Weeds will exhibit swelling of the coleoptile region, stubby, thick primary root development and lack of secondary roots. Plants die from lack of ability to obtain moisture.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply when heavy rain is forecast. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crops or cut for hay. There are not sufficient data available to support such use. Re-cropping: Do not grow oats, sugar beet and small-seeded grasses such as timothy, canaryseed grass and creeping red fescue in rotation following a crop treated with Edge herbicide. If ethalfluralin and/or trifluralin have been used at the oilseed and special crop rate for 2 consecutive years, wheat should not be seeded. Do not direct seed (zero till) a rotational crop into standing stubble on land that has been treated with trifluralin or ethalfluralin for the previous crop. Cultivation prior to seeding of the rotational crop is strongly recommended to help aerate the soil and promote seedbed conditions, which will enhance seed germination.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Caution: The persistence of Edge herbicide is influenced by soil moisture and the majority of breakdown occurs during the growing season. If drought or extended dry periods were present in the previous year, higher levels of Edge herbicide may be present in the soil. To reduce the possibility of injury to rotational crops, seed shallow into a warm, moist seedbed using recommended agronomic practices and seeding depths. As an additional safety precaution, seeding rate may be increased slightly (10%).

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground equipment. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 60 - 80 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Do not exceed recommended rate and apply at appropriate growth stage for each crop. Apply product in warm weather. Do not apply under drought conditions. Application must be made before the crop shields the weeds.   

## How it works   

Susceptible plants convert 2,4-DB to 2,4-D. Certain legumes do not convert it. 2,4-DB is translocated to actively growing parts.   

## Expected results   

Weeds should die within 2 to 3 weeks of treatment. Smartweeds seedlings only stunted.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall before the foliage has dried from the spraying may decrease activity. Grazing: Do not use  treated crops for grazing of livestock or green feed until 30 days after application.

## How it works   

Bromoxynil is a contact type herbicide; therefore, good spray coverage is essential. Inhibits photosynthesis  and plant respiration. Fluroxypyr and 2,4-D ester herbicides are selective for broad leaf control in grassy crops.  The components of these products move within the plant to control exposed and underground plant tissue.  It mimics naturally occurring plant hormones and controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms include twisting of stems and swollen nodes.   

## Expected results   

Small burnt spots on the leaf can appear within hours, while death takes up to 2 weeks. Poor results may be expected if poor coverage, poor penetration through dense crop canopy. Weeds start to twist shortly after spraying. After twisting and bending, plants stop growing, turn brown and die.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Grazing: Do not use treated crops for grazing livestock or green feed until 30 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter.   

Pre-harvest interval: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application. Re-cropping: Fields treated with Enforcer D can be seeded the following year to barley, canola, flax, forage grasses, lentil, mustard, oats, pea, rye, wheat or fields can be summerfallowed. Re-entry interval: 24 hours.

## Application information   

Rate: 0.253* - 0.500 L/acre.   

* Use the 0.253 L/acre rate only when the weeds are smaller and the fields have light infestation of weeds.   

## Mixing instructions   

Half fill the tank with clean water. Add the required amount of Enforcer M and agitate thoroughly. Add any tank  mix partners. Fill the tank and agitate again before use.   

## Application information   

Optimum activity requires active crop and weed growth. The temperature range for optimum activity is 12 to 24°C. Reduced activity will occur when temperatures are below 8°C or above 27°C. Frost before application (3 days) or shortly after (3 days) may reduce weed control and crop tolerance.   

## How it works   

Bromoxynil is a contact-type herbicide; therefore, good spray coverage is essential. Inhibits photosynthesis and plant respiration. Fluroxypyr and MCPA ester herbicides are selective and non-residual. The components of these products move within the plant to control exposed and underground plant tissue. It mimics naturally occurring plant hormones and controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms include twisting of stems and swollen nodes.   

## Expected results   

Small burnt spots on the leaf can appear within hours. Death takes up to 2 weeks. Poor results may be expected  if poor coverage, poor penetration through dense crop canopy. Weeds start to twist shortly after spraying. After twisting and bending, plants stop growing, turn brown and die.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Re-entry interval: 24 hours. Re-cropping: Fields can be seeded the following year to barley, canola, flax, forage grasses, lentil, mustard, oats, pea, rye and wheat, or fields can be summerfallowed. Grazing: Do not use treated crops for grazing livestock or green feed until 30 days after application. Do not harvest forage or cut hay within 30 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter. Pre-harvest interval: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application.

## Application information   

How to apply: With ground equipment only. Water volume: Ground – cereals,   

seed grasses – 45 L/acre.  Corn – 90 - 140 L/acre. Summerfallow/stubble (thistles) – 45 - 90 L/acre. Reduced tillage: 20 - 45 L/acre. Pastures, Rangeland frasses – 45 - 90 L/acre. Prior to seeding cereal (pre-seeding weed burndown) –  20 - 45 L/acre. Roundup Ready 2 Xtend Soybean: minimum of 40 L/acre, ground application only. Engenia can be applied up to a maximum of 793 mL/acre in a single growing season.   

## Application tips   

Canada thistle and perennial sow thistle control in summerfallow and stubble: Apply before thistles reach early bud stage (15 to 25 cm tall). For the most effective control of Canada thistle, follow a long-term approach that includes in crop, post-harvest and summerfallow treatments, in conjunction with tillage operations. If application is made after September 1, or if soil moisture levels are extremely low after application, crop injury may occur in the spring following application. Perennial rosette control in summerfallow: For Canada thistle and/or perennial sow

thistle only, perform the final tillage operation the last week of July or first week of August. Allow thistles to regrow for a minimum of 4 weeks and apply when the majority of thistles have emerged. Apply before thistles reach early bud stage (15 to 25 cm tall) and at least 2 weeks prior to killing frost.   

Engenia applied to Roundup Ready 2 Xtend Soybeans must be applied using nozzles delivering extremely coarse to ultra-coarse droplets.   

Best when crop is under good growing conditions and air temperature 10 to 25°C. Avoid application when crop is under stress from adverse environmental conditions. Do not spray if risk of frost or severe drop in night temperature is forecast. Do not use on bentgrass. Apply only at recommended crop stage, otherwise, crop damage can occur.   

## How it works   

Absorbed through roots and leaves and translocated in phloem and xylem, disrupting the metabolism.   

## Expected results   

Weeds: Results may take 10 to 14 days to appear. Proliferation of tissues in plant causes twisting, bending of stem  and leaf petioles; cupping of leaves; increase in root size; increase in fibrous roots. Crops: Shortening of straw may occur in treated crops without adverse affects on yield. If applied at other than recommended crop stage, head and stem deformities may occur. Crops under stress from adverse environmental conditions may suffer a further setback. Crop injury may be offset by weed control obtained.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 4 hours of application may reduce activity. Re-cropping: When Engenia/Oracle/Ammo is  applied at 1 L/acre on fallow or stubble, grow only beans (white), cereals, corn (field, sweet) or soybeans the next year. After Engenia/Oracle/Ammo (510 mL/acre) + Roundup (690 mL/acre) for thistle control, grow the above crops or canola. If application is after September 1 or if soil is dry subsequent to application, crop injury may occur next spring. Grazing restrictions: Canaryseed – use seed only as bird seed. Cereals, seedling grasses: follow as per grazing and haying restrictions. Corn: Do not graze or harvest for silage until 7 days after Engenia/Oracle/Ammo alone or Engenia/Oracle/Ammo + 2,4-D Amine; at least 12 weeks after other tank mixes.   

Pastures, rangeland, non-crop area (meat animals): If treated vegetation has been consumed by meat animals within 30 days of Engenia/Oracle/Ammo application, feed the animal with untreated diet for 30 days before slaughter. Meat animals may graze or feed on treated pasture 30 days after Engenia/Oracle/Ammo application without restrictions on slaughter. Grazing and hay restrictions (dairy cattle): (Days = time between treatment and grazing or cutting.) Up to 500 mL/acre – zero days; 501 - 930 mL/acre: – 7 days; 931 mL/acre - 1.86 L/acre –  14 days; 1.87 - 2.87 L/acre – 30 days. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Engenia/Oracle/Ammo may cause injury to desirable trees and plants, particularly soybean, flowers, fruit trees, ornamentals, pea, potato, tomato and other broadleaf plants especially in their developmental and growing stage. Leave an adequate buffer zone between treatment areas and sensitive plants.

## Expected results   

Weeds: Absorbed by the weed shoot; therefore, most affected weeds will not emerge. Numerous chlorotic and bleached shoots may be visible by removing the top few inches of treated soil. Provides effective weed control for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. Crops: If crop seedlings are weak, some injury may occur.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Soluble in water, may leach under wet conditions. Grazing: Do not graze or harvest for livestock feed in year of treatment. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not apply within 45 days of harvest. Re-cropping: No restrictions.   

Re-entry interval: 24 hours.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground or aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 20 - 40 L/acre. Air – 12 - 20 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Erebus Xtreme must be applied early postemergence, to the main flush of actively growing weeds. Conditions favouring active weed growth enhance herbicide activity allowing maximum foliar uptake and contact activity. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed and re-growth may occur. For best results, ensure thorough spray coverage of target weeds. Degree of control and duration of effect are dependent on weed sensitivity, weed size, crop competition, growing conditions at and following treatment, and spray coverage.   

## How it works   

Erebus Xtreme contains pyroxsulam which inhibits the production of the ALS enzyme in plants. This enzyme is essential for the production of certain amino acids which are essential for plant growth. Erebus Xtreme also contains a systemic auxin-type herbicide and moves within the plant for control of exposed and underground plant tissues. The product controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns.   

## Expected results   

Actively growing susceptible weeds stop growing. Depending on species, growing conditions and crop competition, leaf discoloration occurs within 1-3 weeks after application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast in 1 hour. Grazing: Livestock may be grazed on treated crops 7 days following application.   

Re-cropping: Fields treated can be seeded the following year to barley, canola, corn, dry beans (of the species Phaseolus vulgaris), flax, lentils, yellow and brown, mustard, oats, peas, potatoes, soybeans, sunflower, or spring wheat; or fields can be summerfallowed. Pre-harvest Intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground equipment. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 - 90 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Add surfactant when tank mixing. Apply as a full coverage spray to foliage and stems using equipment that will assure uniform coverage. Use spray preparation within 48 hours or product degradation may occur. If spray preparation is left standing without agitation, thoroughly agitate before spraying. Avoid overspray or drift to  non-target species and aquatic and wildlife habitats.   

## How it works   

Absorbed by foliage. Inhibits cell elongation.   

## Expected results   

Escort rapidly stops growth of susceptible species, however, typical symptoms (discolouration) may not be noticeable for several weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility. Warm, moist conditions following treatment promote the activity of Escort while cold, dry conditions may reduce or delay activity. Brush and weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be controlled. Degree of control and duration of effect are dependent on the rate used, sensitivity and size of target species, as well as soil moisture and soil temperature.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: No rain-free period is specified on the label. Grazing: Cattle may graze the treated areas on the day of treatment. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Escort is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Leave a 10-metre buffer zone between sprayed area and sensitive habitats.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = > 5,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Store in a cool, dry place. Non-corrosive, non-flammable, non-volatile and does not freeze.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water Volume: 40 - 400 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

If ESPLANADE SC Herbicide is to be applied in a tank mixture with other pesticides, add the appropriate amounts of the tank mix partners in the following order: (a) products in water-soluble packaging (WSP’s), (b) wettable powder (WP’s), (c) wettable granules (WG’s) or other dry flowables, (d) fertilizers, (e) ESPLANADE SC Herbicide, (f) other aqueous suspension products (SC’s), (g) liquid flowables, (h) emulsifiable concentrates and other organic-solvent based formulations. Continue to fill the tank with water to the desired volume while agitating. Maintain sufficient agitation during application to ensure a uniform spray mixture.   

## Application tips   

For best results use flat fan nozzles or comparable nozzles to achieve uniform spray distribution. Do not apply with application equipment that does not provide uniform coverage. Excessive plant debris present on the soil surface at time of application may prevent uniform product distribution reaching the soil and reduce weed control. Performance may be improved by removing excessive debris prior to product application. Avoid disturbing treated soil after application of Esplanade SC Herbicide.   

## How it works   

Esplanade SC Herbicide controls weeds by reducing the emergence of seedlings through inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis (CB Inhibitor). Necrosis or yellowing may also be observed if the herbicide is applied to herbaceous tissue such as leaves and green stems of susceptible plants.   

## Expected results   

Weed seeds and seedlings must come into contact with Esplanade SC Herbicide prior to emergence to be controlled. Esplanade SC Herbicide applied alone will not control weeds that are already emerged. If weeds have emerged, a foliar active post emergent herbicide must be added. If sufficient moisture is present, some weeds may germinate and emerge from below the treated layer   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Not specified. Grazing: There are no grazing or haying restrictions for non-lactating or lactating animals (including cattle, horses, sheep and goats) when using Esplanade SC herbicide alone as directed.

back to Table of Contents   

Water volume: Broadleaf weeds – 80 - 220 L/acre. Brush control – 300 - 500 L/acre.   

When to apply: Broadleaf weeds – apply during the month of May or in early fall. Some species may require a second treatment. Spray weed infested areas with an even spray pattern, making sure weeds shielded by high grass are thoroughly wetted. Spray tall weeds to runoff. Brush control – apply on foliage and stems just before or just after brush is in full leaf in late spring or early fall. Many species may require re-treatment the following year.   

Basal treatment (not ash or basswood) – any time of year. Frill treatment – standing trees more than 13 to 15 cm in diameter.   

Stump treatment:   

immediately after cutting.   

## Application tips   

Crops under stress from adverse environmental conditions such as excess moisture, drought, disease, etc. may suffer a further setback when Dichlorprop + 2,4-D is applied, however, the crop injury that may occur is usually offset by the benefits of enhanced weed control. Apply in warm weather when the crop and weeds are growing well and the weeds are at a susceptible stage. Avoid application during drought conditions or during exceptionally hot weather.   

## How it works   

A systemic herbicide absorbed by leaf and stem.   

## Expected results   

Twisting and curling of weeds will commence 2 to 10 days after application. Growth ceases; eventually plants turn brown and die. Poor results may be expected if poor coverage or low relative humidity during and after spraying.   

## Restrictions   

Pre-harvest intervals: 40 days. Rainfall: Rain within 3 to 4 hours of application may reduce control. Grazing: Do not graze or cut treated crops for forage until 40 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

2,4-D + dichlorprop formulations are moderately to highly toxic to aquatic organisms. These formulations are also toxic to small mammals, birds, aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zones specified  on the label.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 2, 4-D, 300 - 1,000 mg/kg, dichlorprop = 800 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

May be stored at any temperature. Shake well after storing for 1 year or longer.

* Reduction in wild oats control may be observed with this tank mix partner. ** Addition of a second surfactant is not required.  *** Apply tank-mix in at least 45 L/acre of water. **** Not registered.   

UPL AgroSolutions supports the following, non-registered mixes: Akito, Akito+2,4-Ester, Akito+MCPA Ester, Barricade II, Enforcer D, Frontline 2,4-D, Momentum, Stellar XL, tribenuron (Express SG, Spike).   

## Application information   

Apply with: Ground and aerial appliction. Water volume: Ground – 22.5 - 45 L/acre. Aerial – 11 L/acre minimum.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “d” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

When spraying under the conditions of waterlogged or saturated soils, temperature extremes such as heat or freezing weather, drought, low fertility or plant disease wheat can show unacceptable injury symptoms. Weed control may also be reduced by these same conditions.   

## How it works   

Flucarbazone-sodium is a systemic herbicide that is absorbed by both leaves and roots and moves rapidly to the growing point of the plant.   

## Expected results   

Growth of susceptible plants stops soon after application. Symptoms include discolouration (yellowing, reddening and purpling) and complete control may take 1 to 2 weeks.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if it is raining or if rainfall is expected within 1 hour after application. Grazing: Do not graze treated fields or use green crop for feed. Wheat grain or straw from harvested treated fields may be fed to livestock.   

Pre-harvest intervals: Observe minimum interval to harvest of 80 days after treatment. Re-cropping:   

The following crops may be planted 11 months after an application of Everest. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Do not apply during periods of dead calm or when winds are gusty. Do not apply with spray droplets smaller than the American Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE S572.1) coarse classification. Boom height must be 60 cm or less above the crop or ground.   

## How it works   

Exhilarate is a mixture of a systemic auxin-type herbicides (Group 4) and an ALS enzyme inhibitor-type herbicide (Group 2). The product controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns and/or by inhibiting production of the enzyme essential for production of certain amino acids essential for plant growth.   

## Expected results   

Weeds start to twist between 2 to 20 days after spraying, dependent on weather conditions and nature of weeds. Following twisting and bending, plants will turn brown and die.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Applications are rain fast within 1 hour of application. Grazing: Livestock may be grazed on treated crops 7 days following application. Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Exhilarate can be seeded after a minimum of 10 months to alfalfa, spring wheat, spring barley, canola, faba bean, flax, field corn, Juncea canola, field pea, potato (except seed potato), oriental, brown and yellow mustard, soybean, oats, sunflower or dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris species including pinto, kidney and white types). Lentil can be planted 22 months after application of Exhilarate. Pre-harvest Intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application. Do not cut the treated crop for hay or silage within 21 days after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zone of 1 metre between terrestrial and water habitats.   

## Toxicity   

Exhilarate A: Oral LD50   

(rats) = >5000 mg/kg. MCPA Ester 600: Oral LD50

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground equipment. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 22 - 44 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “e” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Effectiveness may be reduced if spray mixture remains in the tank for more than 24 hours.   

## How it works   

Absorbed by foliage and roots, inhibits cell elongation and disrupting metabolism.   

## Expected results   

Growth of susceptible weeds stops immediately. However, typical symptoms (discoluoration) of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility. Degree of control and duration of effect depend on weed sensitivity, weed size, spray coverage and growing conditions.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rain soon after application may reduce control. Grazing and harvesting: Do not graze or feed to livestock within 7 days of application.   

Re-cropping: Fields treated with a spring or chemfallow application of EXPRESS® FX Herbicide can be seeded to any crop the following season.   

Post-harvest application fields can be spring seeded to spring and durum wheat, barley and oats. To seed canola, field corn, soybean, lentil or white bean the spring after fall application, contact the manufacturer for specific fall application timing recommendations. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Overspray or drift to important wildlife habitats such as shelterbelts, wetlands, sloughs or dry slough borders, or woodlots should be avoided. Do not contaminate irrigation water. Toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. With the co-pack, observe a 3-metre buffer zone,  and for Express FX, use a 5-metre buffer zone for terrestrial habitat.

## Application tips   

Do not use more than 7 g/acre/year. Do not apply to crops underseeded to legumes or grasses. With any summerfallow treatment, allow at least 10 days to elapse between treatment and tillage. Only weeds emerged at time of application will be controlled. Weeds must be actively growing at time of application or control might be reduced.  Do not re-enter treated fields until 12 hours after application. Once dissolved, Express Pro herbicides will not settle out, even if the sprayer is parked for long periods of time. Spray preparation should be used within 24 hours or product degradation may occur.   

Do not use on highly variable soils that have large gravelly or sandy areas, eroded knolls or calcium deposits.   

• Express Pro applied to fields to be planted to spring wheat, durum wheat, winter wheat or barley that are stressed by severe conditions such as drought, low fertility, saline soils, waterlogged soils (soils at or near field capacity), disease or insect damage may result in crop injury as crop injury may occur. Heavy rainfall soon after application may result in visual crop injury or possible yield reduction. Conditions such as thin crop stand, sandy soil or low soil organic matter may increase the severity of injury.   

## How it works   

Express Pro rapidly stops growth of susceptible weeds. However, typical symptoms (discolouration) of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility. Degree of control and duration of effect depend on weed sensitivity, weed size, spray coverage and growing conditions. Activity of the herbicide mixture may be delayed by cold, dry conditions after application.   

Rainfall: Heavy rainfall immediately after application may wash the herbicide off the foliage, which may reduce  the effectiveness of Express Pro. Do not apply if rain is forecast for the time of application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application if heavy rain is forecast. Re-cropping: Fields treated with Express Pro may be seeded to wheat (spring, durum or winter) or spring barley a minimum of 24 hours after application. The following crops may be seeded 10 months after application: Canola,  dry bean, flax, faba bean, field corn, lentil, soybean, oats and pea. Grazing: Refer to glyphosate label. Post-harvestapplication: Fields can be spring seeded to spring and durum wheat, barley and oats. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Use a buffer zone of 4 metres between sprayed area and sensitive habitat.   

## Toxicity

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “e” on page 15.   

## Application Tips   

Effectiveness may be reduced if spray mixture remains in the tank for more than 24 hours. Injury to pulse crops may occur on coarse-textured soils, low in organic matter (less than 3%), or in fields with variable soils, gravely areas, sandy areas or eroded knolls. Avoid planting pulse crops in soils containing more than 50% sand.   

## How it works   

Absorbed by foliage and roots, inhibits cell elongation.   

## Expected results   

Express SG stops the growth of susceptible weeds immediately. However, typical symptoms (discolouration) of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility. Degree of control and duration of effect depend on weed sensitivity, weed size, spray coverage and growing conditions.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: If rain occurs soon after application, control may be reduced. Heavy rainfall soon after application may result in visual crop injury or possible yield reduction. Environmental conditions that slow the drying of the spray mix on the foliage may increase the time required. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not apply within 70 days of harvest for ExpressSun®   

sunflowers. Re-cropping: The following crops can be seeded 2 months after application of Express SG herbicide –canola and flax. Fields treated with Express SG may be seeded to winter wheat.   

Post-harvest: Fields treated with a post-harvest application of Express SG in the fall can be seeded in the spring to spring wheat (including durum), spring barley, oats, canary seed, pulse crops (including chickpea, dry bean, faba bean, field pea, lentil, lupin and soybean), alfalfa, red clover, alsike clover, smooth bromegrass, meadow bromegrass, timothy, creeping red fescue, crested wheatgrass, slender wheatgrass, meadow fescue, tall fescue, hybrid bromegrass, yellow sweet clover and sainfoin, or fields may be summer fallowed.) To spring seed canola, field corn or flax after a post-harvest application of Express SG, please contact the manufacturer for specific fall application timing recommendations. Grazing: Livestock may graze on  pasture and rangeland without restrictions following treatment.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Do not use on highly variable soils that have large gravely or sandy areas, eroded knolls or calcium deposits. Conditions such as thin crop stand, sandy soil or low soil organic matter may increase the severity of injury.  EXPRESS® SG Herbicide applied to pre-seed to fields that are stressed by severe conditions such as drought, low fertility, saline soils, waterlogged soils (soils at or near field capacity), disease or insect damage may result in crop injury. Drought, disease or insect damage following application may also result in crop injury, grade or yield loss.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Fierce EZ is a soil-applied residual herbicide and will only control weeds emerging after the product has been activated by moisture. Weeds present at the time of application should be controlled with a suitable tank mix partner (see Registered Tank Mixes section). DO NOT incorporate or till after an application of Fierce EZ. Seeding after an application of Fierce EZ should only be done with low disturbance seeding systems.  Significant crop injury may occur from applications made to poorly drained soils and/or applications made under cool, wet conditions. Severe crop injury will result when soils are flooded following applications of Fierce EZ. Treated soil that is splashed onto newly emerging crops may result in temporary injury.   

Moisture is necessary to activate Fierce EZ in the soil for residual weed control. Dry weather following applications of Fierce EZ may reduce effectiveness. However, when adequate moisture is received after dry conditions, Fierce EZ will control susceptible germinating weeds listed on the label. Fierce EZ may not control weeds that germinate after application but prior to an activating rainfall/irrigation or weeds that germinate through cracks resulting from dry soil.

## How it works   

Flumioxazin controls weeds by inhibiting protoporphyrinogen oxidase, an essential enzyme required by plants for chlorophyll biosynthesis. Seedling weeds are controlled pre-emergence, or shortly after exposure to sunlight following contact with the soil applied herbicide. Pyroxasulfone controls weeds by inhibiting the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids. Pyroxasulfone halts growth at the apical meristem and coleoptile by reducing cell division and expansion. Weeds affected by Pyroxasulfone may not emerge or may emerge with irregular leaf margins and reduced growth.   

## Expected results   

Susceptible weeds will die before emergence or shortly after exposure to sunlight. Some species may remain green and stunted for several days prior to senescence.   

## Restrictions   

Mechanical incorporation or disturbance of the soil after application will reduce weed control. Rainfall: 1 hour.   

Grazing: For field corn, do not permit livestock to graze field within 93 days after application and do not harvest as green feed or silage within 93 days after application. For soybeans, do not harvest as green feed or permit livestock to graze fields within 21 days after application and do not cut hay/fodder within 50 days after application. For wheat (spring and winter), do not harvest as green feed or permit livestock to graze fields within 42 days after application and do not cut hay/fodder within 52 days after application. For all other crops, do not graze, cut or feed treated crops to livestock.   

Re-cropping: No restrictions: soybean, chickpea, field pea. 7 days – field corn, spring wheat, winter wheat.  6 months – lentil. 11 months – barley, durum wheat, oats, alfalfa. 12 months – canola, mustard seed. For crops not listed a successful bioassay must be preformed before planting. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: Ground: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Optimum activity requires active crop and weed growth. The temperature range for optimum activity is 8°C to 24°C. Frost before application (3 days) or shortly after (3 days) may reduce weed control and crop tolerance. Weed control may be reduced during stress conditions, for example, drought, heat or cold stress, if weeds have initiated flowering or if heavy infestations exist. Application before the 4-leaf stage of wheat and barley may cause severe twisting of leaves and leaf, stem and head deformities, which may reduce yield up to 10%. Do not apply later than the flag-leaf stage. Some twisting may be evident on barley. This twisting is transitory and may disappear within 3 weeks.   

## How it works   

The components of these products move within the plant to control exposed and underground plant tissue.  It mimics naturally occurring plant hormones and controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms include twisting of stems and swollen nodes.

## Expected results   

Broadleaf weeds: Weeds start to twist shortly after spraying. After twisting and bending, plants stop growing,  turn brown and die.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if rain is expected in 1 hour. Grazing: Do not permit lactating dairy animals to graze fields within 7 days after application. Do not harvest forage or cut for hay within 30 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days prior to slaughter. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated mature crop within 60 days after application. Re-cropping: Fields treated with these products can be seeded the following year to alfalfa, barley, canola, corn, dry bean, flax, forage grass, lentil, mustard, oats, pea, potato, rye, soybean, sugar beet, sunflower, wheat or summerfallowed. Do not seed crops other than those listed above for at least 1 year following treatment. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Leave a 15-metre buffer between sprayed area and aquatic habitat. Runoff: Under certain conditions, these products have the potential to runoff from treated areas. To reduce runoff from treated areas into aquatic habitats, consider the characteristics and conditions of the site before treatment.  Site characteristics and conditions that may lead to runoff include, but are not limited to heavy rainfall, moderate to steep slope, bare soil, poorly draining soil (e.g., soils that are compacted, fine textured or low in organic matter such as clay). Avoid application of this product when heavy rain is forecast. Contamination of aquatic areas as a result of runoff may be reduced by including a vegetative strip (buffer zone) between the treated area and the edge of the water body.

## Application information   

## CS-100-23235; CS-75-23235; CS-100-2525; CS-75-2525:   

Ground application: Water volume – 22 L/acre.   

## CS-100-2525; CS-75-2525:   

Aerial application: Water volume – 10 - 20 L/acre. When a tank mixture is used, consult the labels of the tank-mix partners.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “e” on page 11.   

## Application tips   

Effectiveness may be reduced if spray mixture remains in the tank for more than 24 hours. Do not apply to crops underseeded to legumes or grasses as injury to forage may result.   

## How it works   

Absorbed by foliage. Inhibits cell elongation.   

## Expected results   

PrecisionPac Cross Spectrum Herbicides stop the growth of susceptible weeds immediately. However, typical symptoms (discolouration) of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility. Degree of control and duration of effect depend on weed sensitivity, weed size, spray coverage and growing conditions.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: 2 hours. Grazing: May not be grazed or fed to livestock within 7 days of application.   

## Pre-harvest intervals: Allow 60 days between application and harvest. Re-cropping: CS-100-23235;

## Focus at 33 acres/jug   

All weeds controlled at 40 acres per jug plus carpetweed, cleavers, cocklebur, jimsonweed, kochia, black and Eastern black nightshade, Russian (up to 5 cm tall) thistle, shepherd’s purse, volunteer canola (including glyphosate-tolerant)   

For burn-off control of emerged weeds, if glyphosate is not used with Focus, the addition of an adjuvant is required. Use a non-ionic surfactant (NIS) at 0.25% v/v (0.25 L per 100 L of spray solution) or use Merge at 1% v/v.   

## Registered tank mixes   

Pre-plant/pre-emergence: Aatrex Liquid 480 (0.85 to 1.25 L/acre) field corn only – glyphosate (at recommended rates). Pre-seed spring or winter wheat, soybean, field pea: Express SG + glyphosate (180 g ae/acre). Do not apply products containing saflufenacil with, before or after application of Focus as crop injury may occur. FMC also supports the following tank mixes not on the Focus label. Use the most restrictive use limitation for either label.   

Pre-seed to spring and winter wheat: 2,4-D amine or ester + glyphosate (180 to 360 g ae/acre). Pre-seed spring or winter wheat: Express FX + glyphosate (180 g ae/acre), Intruvix.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre minimum. Focus can be applied only once per growing season. Use a minimum spray volume of 40.5 L/acre. High spray volumes are needed for dense weed stands. Weed control improves with improved coverage.   

Seeding: Focus should be applied to a uniform seedbed that is firm and clod free. Spring and winter wheat, lentil and field corn seeds must be planted at least 2.5 cm deep. Soybean must be planted a minimum of 4 cm deep.   

Fall Application: FOCUS Herbicide should be applied to the stubble or soil surface and allow moisture from rainfall or snow to move the product into the soil. Do not mechanically incorporate in the fall or spring as this can destroy the herbicide barrier and allow weeds to escape. Do not apply to frozen soils or existing snow cover to prevent runoff. For fall treatments use an extended control treatment rate for the appropriate soil type and organic matter.   

## Expected results   

Extremes in environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, soil conditions and cultural practices may  affect activity. Moisture is necessary to activate the active ingredient pyroxasulfone in soil for weed control. Dry weather following applications may reduce effectiveness.  Applications to crops under stress due to either inadequate or excess moisture for normal crop development, cool and hot temperatures, sodic soils, poorly drained soils, hail damage, flooding, pesticide injury, mechanical injury or widely fluctuating temperatures may result in crop injury.

Note: For crops not listed above, use a field bioassay to confirm crop safety. If there is a lack of adequate or normal soil moisture due to drought conditions following an application of FOCUS® Herbicide, the minimum rotational crop interval described above must be extended for one additional year that the drought has occurred and a representative bioassay of the field must be conducted with the potential rotational crop and adequate soil moisture to determine the crop sensitivity to FOCUS® Herbicide.   

Focus requires 12.5 mm, or more, of moisture at once to activate product. Do not follow a fall application of FOCUS® Herbicide (or any other product containing pyroxasulfone) with a spring application of AUTHORITY®   

480 Herbicide (or any other product containing sulfentrazone) to fields where spring wheat will be planted.   

Do not apply AUTHORITY® SUPREME Herbicide (or any other product containing pyroxasulfone) in the spring to fields that were treated with applications of FOCUS® Herbicide (or any other product containing pyroxasulfone) during the previous fall. Do not make more than one application of Focus® herbicide (or other products containing pyroxasulfone) per 12 month period. Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour of application, or heavy rains shortly after application, may reduce weed control of carfentrazone component of product. Moderate rainfall will improve the activity of the pyroxasulfone part of the herbicide. Excessive rainfall, irrigation or prolonged saturated soil conditions after application may increase the risk of seedling injury, especially shallow seeded crops. Focus can affect lentil and field pea growth under conditions that include high pH (≥7.5), cool weather, prolonged and excessive moisture, seedling diseases and other conditions unfavourable to growth. It can appear as stunting or discolouration. Symptoms may persist until conditions improve. Grazing: Do not graze or feed on wheat grain, forage, hay or straw less than 42 days after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not use on peat or muck soils and soils with 7% or more organic matter content or on soils classified as sand, containing >1% organic matter. Use a buffer of 5 metres between treated area and sensitive terrestrial or freshwater habitats.

Fall surface application: Where fields are prone to water and/or wind erosion and fall tillage is therefore undesirable, fall surface applications should be made after October 1 or within 3 weeks of soil freeze-up (average soil temperature at the 5 cm depth should be 4°C or less). Fall surface application should be made to standing stubble, chem fallow or summerfallow fields in a state of low soil erodibility. Avoid smooth, hard-packed soil conditions in summerfallow, which may allow granules to drift. Surface applications should not be made to fields covered in snow or that have excessive crop residue, which will not allow granules contact with soil. Under excessively warm and/or wet conditions between application and crop emergence, control may be reduced. For best results under heavy wild oats infestations, use the incorporated treatments only.   

## Incorporation   

Time: The first incorporation should be completed within 24 hours of application, except for the fall surface application. The second incorporation may then be done during the fall or delayed until the spring.

For surface applications: Incorporate twice at right angles in the spring. Early seeding and a delayed second incorporation of 48 hours or more will provide best results.   

Do not incorporate this product more than 5 cm. This can be accomplished by setting the tillage equipment  to work the soil not deeper than 7.5 cm to 10 cm.   

Implement: Before applying this product, be sure the soil is in good working condition. All deep tillage by cultivation or double disc implements must be completed prior to application of this product.   

## Application tips   

Calibrate equipment to deliver desired amount of product. Use only a hoe-drill or a double disc press drill to seed barley or wheat into a Fortress-treated field. Do not apply to soil with less than 2% organic matter if it is to be seeded to wheat. Do not apply Fortress for wheat on land that has been treated with trifluralin since June 1 of the previous year.   

Seeding: Flax, mustard and rapeseed can be seeded in treated layers. Barley and wheat are more sensitive and should be planted 6 to 7.5 cm. Wheat must be seeded at least 1 cm below the treated layer. Do not seed deeper than 7.5 cm. To ensure an even crop stand, increase the usual seeding rate of barley and wheat by 10%. Seed into warm, moist seedbed. A pre-seed burn-off herbicide treatment is required to eliminate weed competition prior to crop emergence.   

## How it works   

Absorbed by wild oats shoots and foxtail roots, usually resulting in death before emergence. Under dry conditions, some wild oats and foxtail may emerge before being killed.   

## Expected results   

Weeds: Wild oats and foxtail die before they emerge. Weed control may be reduced under conditions of prolonged, cool soil temperatures at the time of germination or extreme drought in spring. Crops: Thinning in barley and wheat are known to occur under conditions of heavy rainfall and/or cold weather after application and before crop emergence. In most cases, thinning is more than offset by tillering. Some thinning may be noted on eroded knolls. Poor results may be expected if there is incomplete incorporation due to wet, cloddy soil or heavy trash, very dry  soil conditions in spring or prolonged cool soil temperatures at time of germination. Ridges left by seeding may disrupt the treated layer and allow escapes.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Moisture is required for activation. Rainfall of at least 1.5 cm within 2 weeks of application in the spring is required to ensure maximum performance. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crop or cut for hay; there are not sufficient data to support such use.   

Re-cropping: Under normal conditions, Fortress MicroActiv carryover will not harm crops grown in rotation.  As a precaution, tame oats, sugar beet, creeping red fescue and small-seeded grasses such as timothy and canary seed should not be grown in rotation following a Fortress-treated crop. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not apply this product directly to aquatic habitats. Do not contaminate irrigation or drinking water supplies or aquatic habitats by cleaning of equipment or disposal of wastes.

## Supported tank mixes   

MPower MCPA Ester at 190 mL/acre, Aurora, HellCat, Axial, Everest, Simplicity, Traxos   

## Application information   

Ground equipment only. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Ensure thorough spray coverage of target weeds and use higher water volumes with dense crop canopy and/or large weeds. If application is stopped prior to completion, re-suspend spray solution by full agitation prior to commencing spraying again. Product will degrade if left in the sprayer for more than 24 hours after mixing. Frost 3 days before or 3 days after application may reduce weed control and crop tolerance.   

## How it works   

Foxxy CRX is a combination of 3 systemic herbicides. Typical symptoms (discolouration, twisting of stems) of  dying weeds may not be visible for several days to 2 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions.   

## Expected results   

Complete control of weeds may take 3 to 4 weeks. When weeds are stressed, control can be reduced or delayed since weeds are not actively growing. Do not make applications to weeds stressed longer than 20 days due to lack of moisture as unsatisfactory control can result. Application to crops that are stressed by severe weather conditions, frost, low fertility, water-logged soil (soil at or near field capacity), disease or insect damage may result in crop injury.

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 4 hours may reduce weed control. Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Grazing: Livestock may graze treated areas 7 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated areas at least 3 days before slaughter. Allow 7 days after application before cutting hay or harvesting forage. Mature crops may be harvested 60 days after application. Re-cropping: 1 year after application – wheat, barley, canola, rye, sugar beet, flax, mustard, oat, pea or summerfallow. Very dry soil conditions after application can result in risk of injury to peas the following year. For pea rotation, rainfall from June 1 to August 31 in the year of application must be greater than 140 mm (5.5 inches) and annual rainfall must be greater than 175 mm (6.9 inches). Contact NewAgco for further information.   

## Environmental precautions   

Some of the components in this product are highly toxic to non-target terrestrial plants and aquatic organisms. Avoid contamination of aquatic systems during application and observe buffer zones specified on the component labels. Runoff and leaching: Do not apply to irrigated land where tail water will be used to irrigate cropland. Do not contaminate irrigation water. Do not use on highly variable soils that have large gravelly or sandy areas, eroded knolls, or calcium deposits.

1Apply when chickweed is small (1- 6 leaf) and actively growing, but before crop canopy prevents thorough herbicide coverage of weeds. Chickweed emerging after application will not be controlled. Biotypes resistant to Group 2 herbicides will not be controlled. 2Including Group 2 resistant biotypes.  3Not including Group 2 resistant biotypes. 4ClearField volunteers are controlled with an additional 132 mL/ac MCPA 600 Ester. 5Apply to actively growing wild buckwheat in the cotyledon to 3 leaf stage. Under environmental stress, such as dry weather, control may be reduced. Large plants may re-grow after treatment. 6Apply when the majority of thistles have emerged and are actively growing. For best top growth control, apply before bud stage when thistles are no larger than 15 cm in height and before crop canopy prevents thorough coverage of weeds. A single application will effectively inhibit the ability of emerged thistles to compete with the crop. Later emerging thistles will not be suppressed.7Apply to actively growing round leaved mallow from the 2 - 6 leaf stage. Foxxy MR will keep mallow stunted, but may not reduce overall populations. 8Apply to toadflax that is no larger than 15 cm in height. A control program for this weed includes both frequent tillage and chemical application   

## Registered tank mixes   

None registered. AgraCity supports the following tank mixes not on the label. Apply mixes according to the most restrictive use limitations for either product. Herbicides: Axial, Aurora, HellCat, Himalaya, Simplicity, Traxos.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 22 L/acre minimum.   

## Mixing instructions   

Fill sprayer tank ½ full with clean water. Maintain agitation throughout mixing and application process. Add MPower R and agitate for 5 minutes. Add any liquid tank mix partner, followed by Foxxy and MCPA Ester. Add any required surfactant last.   

## Application tips   

Use higher water volumes for dense crop canopy or larger weeds. Foxxy MR left in the tank for more than 24 hours may have reduced efficacy. When the crop is under stress, transient crop injury such as discoloration or reduced height may occur. Best results will occur when temperatures are between 12   

0   

C and 24   

0   

C when the weeds are small and actively growing.   

## How it works   

Foxxy MR is absorbed through the foliage. MPower R inhibits cell elongation. The other components mimic naturally occurring plant hormones and control weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms include twisting of stems and swollen nodes.   

## Expected results   

Growth stops immediately. Discoloration of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 - 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed species.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 4 hours of application will reduce weed efficacy. Grazing: Livestock may graze treated areas 7 days after application. Re-cropping: Grow all major crops the year after application.   

Pre-harvest Intervals: Do not harvest mature crops within 60 days after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

For ground application, use a 15 m buffer between sprayed area and sensitive habitat. Do not contaminate water when cleaning equipment. MCPA is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants and can readily leach in the soil.

## Quackgrass control prior to seeding or after harvest in annual and forage cropping systems   

Apply to actively growing quackgrass. Reduced control may result if rhizomes become dormant. This may occur when soil fertility is poor or land has not been tilled for several years.   

Application on forages should be followed by tillage and should be made when good growing conditions exist.   

## Weed stage   

## Acid equivalent in grams active ingredient per acre   

## Remarks   

## Quackgrass control: season long control on light to moderate infestation   

3 - 4 green leaves. On fall tilled ground, delay the application until majority of quackgrass has  4 - 5 leaves   

360   

Allow 3 or more days after treatment before tillage. Fall treatment should be applied 3 - 4 weeks after swathing to actively growing quackgrass. Do not apply after first damaging frost in the fall. Frost of - 5°C is usually tolerated by new shoots. Frost damage is evident by drying of new shoots shortly after frost   

## Quackgrass control: heavy infestations or sod bound quackgrass   

3 - 4 green leaves  or more   

360 - 1000   

Use higher rate for sod bound quackgrass (left undisturbed for at least 2 years). Allow 3 or more days after treatment before tillage. Fall treatment should be applied 3 - 4 weeks after swathing to actively growing quackgrass. Do not apply after first damaging frost in the fall. Frost of - 5°C is usually tolerated by new shoots   

## Canada thistle control: Summerfallow and post harvest   

## Weed stage   

## Acid equivalent in grams active ingredient per acre   

## Remarks   

## Control of Canada thistle at the rosette stage (summerfallow)   

Rosettes at least 15 cm  in diameter   

360   

Conduct summerfallow tillage as usual and perform the last tillage operation between July 15 and August 1. Allow thistle to re-grow for a minimum of 5 weeks until they are 15 cm in diameter and majority of them are in a rosette stage. Allow 10 or more days after treatment before tillage. Treatment after a mild frost is possible provided leaves are green and plants are actively growing   

## Control of Canada thistle: post-harvest stubble treatment   

Bud stage or beyond   

648 - 1000   

Allow 20 to 25 cm of new growth before application. Thistles must be sprayed at least 2 weeks prior to killing frost.

Caution: Do not apply to any crops if grown for seed.   

* Barley grown for malt and tame oats grown for milling are registered for the pre-harvest application. However, farmers should contact malt barley  and milling oats buyers prior to application to confirm acceptance of glyphosate treated grain.   

** These crops are registered with R/T 540, Roundup Transorb HC, Roundup WeatherMax and Roundup Ultra 2 only under User Requested Minor Use Label Expansion program. The manufacturer assumes no responsibility with respect to performance and/or crop tolerance claims for herbicide performance.   

## How to apply   

Ground (all products). Aerial: Do not apply by air, except Sharpshooter, Shooter Plus, Roundup Transorb HC, Roundup WeatherMax, RT/540, Smoke, MPower Glyphosate.   

Crop staging: Apply when average seed moisture is at or below 30%. Accurate measurement of seed moisture  must be made before application. The following chart lists visual symptoms that can be used as guidelines as to  when 30% grain moisture has been reached.

## Harvest management benefits   

This treatment may also provide harvest management benefits by drying down crop and vegetative crop growth. Apply only during the period 7 to 14 days before harvest to ensure best weed control and to maximize harvest management benefits. Earlier application may reduce crop yield and/or quality and may lead to excess glyphosate residues in the crop. Extremely cool, wet and cloudy weather conditions between time of application and the anticipated harvest date may slow down activity of this product, thereby delaying crop dry down and harvest date.

## Application tips   

Tillage or mowing prior to application will reduce effectiveness on perennial weeds. Minimum days to wait before tillage after application: annual weeds, 1 day; spring and fall quackgrass, 3 days; Canada thistle bud stage, 5 days; fall rosette stage, 7 to 10 days; field bindweed, milkweed and other perennials, seven days. Best results are obtained when temperatures are near 20°C and when weeds are actively growing. Control will be reduced if foliage is heavily covered with dust. Hard water or water containing calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe) ions will reduce the activity of glyphosate. Dirty water or water with suspended soil or organic matter will reduce control.   

## How it works   

A non-selective, systemic herbicide that moves from the foliage into roots and kills the entire plant.   

## Expected results   

Wilting and yellowing of annual weed occurs within 2 to 4 days; perennial requires 7 to 10 days. Complete browning of above ground growth and deterioration of roots occurs. Cool, cloudy conditions may slow activity.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Heavy rainfall immediately after application may wash the chemical off the foliage and a repeat treatment may be required. Do not apply if rainfall is forecast for the time of application. Roundup Transorb HC, Roundup WeatherMax, Roundup Ultra 2, and R/T 540: Rainfall occurring within 60 minutes of treatment may result in reduced weed control. Movement in the soil: Negligible leaching. Grazing restrictions: Do not graze or harvest treated areas until plants have turned brown and started to deteriorate. Re-cropping: No restrictions.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Avoid direct application to any body of water populated with fish or used for domestic purposes. Leave a 15-metre buffer zone between sprayed area and sensitive habitats.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

= 4,320 mg/kg.

Not registered but supported tank mix: Valtera EZ (60 - 90 ml/acre), Fierce EZ (178 ml/acre) prior to emergence.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Apply with ground equipment only. Water volume: Minimum 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Do not apply during periods of dead calm. Do not apply with spray droplets smaller than medium classification. Keep booms lower than 60 cm from target. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed and re-growth may occur. GoldWing will damage emerged crop plants, even in minute quantities. Apply GoldWing prior to the emergence of the crop, either as a pre-seed or pre-emergence application. GoldWing does not provide residual weed control. Apply when weeds are in the seedling stage and actively growing.   

## How it works   

GoldWing is designed for use as a contact and systemic herbicide for broadleaf weed control. Pyraflufen-ethyl, a member of the phenyl pyrazole class of herbicides, inhibits the protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) enzyme, which results in cell membrane destruction and necrosis. MCPA ester, a member of the phenoxy class of herbicides, mimics plant growth regulators, interfering with cell enlargement and division, and development in susceptible plants.   

## Expected results   

Contact activity will be apparent within hours. Initially, leaves will take on a water-soaked appearance before turning necrotic; systemic symptomology will appear over time. Plants will be necrotic and may exhibit epinasty (twisting) before death. Complete plant death will occur within a few days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 2 hours of application may reduce control. Grazing: Do not permit lactating dairy animals to graze field within 7 days of application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields 3 days before slaughter.   

Pre-harvest intervals: Do not graze or cut treated crops for forage until 30 days after application.   

Re-cropping: All crops can be seeded 30 days after an application of GoldWing. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Runoff: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast or to areas with steep slopes and/or compacted clay soils.   

## Toxicity   

Pyraflufen-ethyl: Acute oral LD50

## Application tips   

Apply in spring or early summer after weeds have fully emerged and when weeds are growing rapidly. Ensure that there is adequate coverage of target weeds. Broadleaf crops are extremely sensitive to Grazon XC and care should be taken to prevent drift onto sensitive crops. Use appropriate drift control measures to prevent Grazon XC from affecting sensitive, non-target vegetation. Do not apply on soils that are very permeable (sandy loam to sand) to prevent Grazon XC from affecting sensitive, non-target vegetation through the entire profile and that have an underlying shallow aquifer.   

## How it works   

Interferes with cell division, causing leaf cupping, stem distortion and eventual death of plant. Grazon is absorbed through leaves and roots.   

## Expected results   

Perennial weeds show distorted stems and cupped leaves that turn yellow and then brown. Usually native grass increases in abundance as a result of reduced competition. Poor results may be expected if weeds are not actively growing in late summer or due to drought or frost. Apply up to 2.5 L/acre of Grazon XC to control deciduous trees and wood species listed with high water volumes when foliage is fully developed and actively growing. Maximum 1 application per year. For faster burndown of coniferous species, use a recommended surfactant with Grazon XC at 0.25% or up to 0.375% v/v for maximum rainfastness. Add surfactant after herbicide is mixed.   

## Restrictions   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours. For non-crop areas, don’t enter until spray has dried. Rainfall: If rainfall occurs within 4 hours of application, effectiveness may be reduced. Do not apply if rainfall is forecast for the time of application.

Grazing: Do not allow lactating dairy animals to graze the treated areas within 7 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter. Feed livestock untreated forage for 7 days prior to moving onto land that produce broadleaf crops.   

Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest forage or cut hay within 30 days after application. Re-cropping: Legumes may not be established in a pasture for several years after a Grazon treatment. If legumes are essential in a pasture, do not use Grazon. Do not break up treated pasture and plant to sensitive broadleaf crops for at least 5 years after application of Grazon. Do not move cut forage or manure from treated areas to areas that may be seeded to a sensitive crop.   

## Environmental precautions   

Grazon products are slightly toxic to aquatic organisms, including fish. Grazon products are highly mobile in the  soil and water.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 2,598 mg/kg.

## Registered tank mixes   

Heat Complete must be tank mixed with glyphosate 0.5 - 1 L/acre of 360 g/L equivalent. Merge (200 mL/acre) is always required regardless of glyphosate formulation used.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre. Use higher water volumes for dense weed stands or larger weeds.   

## Mixing instructions   

Do not over agitate at any point in the process. Add products to the spray tank in the following order: Zidua SC – Heat LQ – glyphosate – Merge adjuvant. If foaming occurs, add an anti-foaming agent. Follow mixing instructions “d” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Good growing conditions promote weed growth and enhance the activity of Heat Complete. Weeds hardened off  by cold weather or drought stress may not be controlled. Insufficient water volumes or coarse sprays may also  reduce control levels.   

## How it works   

Heat Complete is rapidly absorbed by root and foliar uptake; once absorbed, it exhibits mobility in plants. Heat LQ is a Group 14 herbicide that inhibits protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO). Cell membrane damage induced by inhibition of PPO leads to plant death. Susceptible weeds develop injury symptoms within hours of application under active growing conditions; plant death occurs within 3 to 5 days depending on growing conditions. Zidua SC is a Group 15 herbicide and controls weeds by inhibiting the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids, which halts growth at the apical meristem and coleoptile by reducing cell division and expansion. Weeds affected by Zidua SC may not emerge, or may emerge with irregular leaf margins and reduced growth.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Follow the glyphosate manufacturer’s recommendation for rainfast. Grazing: Do not graze or cut for  feed within 60 days of application. Pre-harvest interval: After 60 days, all labelled crops can be harvested.   

Re-cropping: In the event of crop failure, only labeled crops may be seeded on fields treated with Heat Complete (rate restrictions apply). All other crops may be seeded 1 year after treatment. Contact manufacturer for additional information on re-cropping intervals. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral toxicity (rats): LD50   

> 2,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Store in a cool, dry place. Do not freeze. If frozen, thaw completely and shake well before use.

**Applications at the 28.4 g/acre rate or 59 mL/acre of the LQ formulation will also provide suppression of the emergence of these weeds.   

## Registered tank mixes   

Heat should always be tank mixed with glyphosate 0.5 - 1 L/acre of 360 g/l equivalent for pre-seed or pre-emergence. For desiccation purposes, Heat can be used by itself or with up to 1 L/acre of 360 g/L equivalent. Merge (200 mL/acre) is always required regardless of the glyphosate formulation used. It is recommended to use  400 mL/acre of Merge when Heat is used on its own as a harvest aid.   

## Application information   

## How to apply:   

Pre-seed/Pre-emerge and chemfallow applications: Ground equipment only. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.  Use higher water volume (40 L/acre) when for dense weed stands or larger weeds.   

## Herbicides

back to Table of Contents   

Pre-harvest: Harvest aid and desiccation applications – ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground application – 80 L/acre alone,  40 L/acre with glyphosate tank mix. Aerial application – 20 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Good growing conditions promote weed growth and enhance the activity of Heat and Heat LQ. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be controlled. Insufficient water volumes or coarse sprays may also reduce control levels. For pre-harvest purposes, apply Heat with glyphosate for broad-spectrum weed management and crop dry down. In lentil, apply when bottom 15% of pods are dry and rattle when shaken. The seed should be less than 30% moisture. In field pea, apply when majority of pods are brown (70 to 80%). For canola, apply at 75 to 80% seed colour change. In dry beans and soy beans, apply when 80 to 90% of leaves have dropped and pods are mature.  Note: Using glyphosate with Heat for pre-harvest purposes may affect seed germination.   

## How it works   

Heat is rapidly absorbed by root and foliar uptake: once absorbed, it exhibits mobility in plants. Heat is a potent inhibitor of protoporhyrinogen oxidase (PPO). Cell membrane damage induced by inhibition of PPO leads to plant death. Susceptible weeds develop injury symptoms within hours of application under active growing conditions; plant death occurs within 3 to 5 days depending on growing conditions.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Follow the glyphosate manufacturers recommendation for rainfast. Grazing: Field corn (60 days), legume forage (chickpea, lentil, field pea, soybean) (60 days), small grains (wheat,barley, oats) 30 days.   

Pre-harvest intervals (at seeding): Leave 60 days between application and harvest. Desiccation pre-harvest interval: Dry, common beans – 2 days. Canola, field pea, red entil, soybean – 3 days. Sunflower – 7 days.   

Re-cropping: Registered crops may be reseeded if necessary in the event of crop failure. Lentils may be reseeded only if the 10.4 g/acre (21.5 mL/acre Heat LQ) rate was applied. Soybeans may only be reseeded if the 10.4 - 14.6 g/acre (21.5 - 29.5 mL/acre Heat LQ) was applied. Canola, dry beans, flax and mustard may be seeded the following year in addition to all registered crops without rate restrictions.   

Re-cropping after pre-harvest application: Barley, canary seed, canola (all types), chickpea, corn (field and sweet), flax, lentils, oats, field pea, soybean and wheat (spring, winter, and durum) can all be seeded the spring after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Registered tank mixes   

No registered tank mixes.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing Instructions   

Fill the tank half with water and begin agitation. Add the Himalaya and fully dissolve. Next, add the Battlefront and mix thoroughly. Add the desired rate of glyphosate and apply.   

## Application tips   

Himalaya Pass must be applied to emerged, actively growing weeds. Warm, moist growing conditions promote active weed growth and enhance the activity of florasulam and flucarbazone by allowing maximum foliar uptake. For best results, ensure thorough spray coverage of target weeds.   

## How it works   

Flucarbazone is a systemic herbicide that is absorbed by both leaves and roots and moves rapidly to the growing point of the plant. Florasulam is taken up by leaves and stops growth of susceptible weeds rapidly via inhibition of the ALS enzyme.   

## Expected results   

Weeds susceptible to Himalaya Pass will stop growing almost immediately. Newer leaves start to yellow and wilt, followed by a loss of green colour. Symptoms will spread to the rest of the plant with some weeds showing purpling or reddening. Under good growing conditions, complete control may occur within 7 to 10 days after application while control may take longer under poor growing conditions.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour after application may reduce weed  Grazing: Do not graze treated fields or use green crop for feed. Wheat grain or straw from harvested treated fields may be fed to livestock. Re-cropping: The following crops may be planted 11 months after an application of this product.

Note: When tank mixing, always add the broadleaf herbicide (Buctril M or Target) to the spray tank first, followed by Horizon NG herbicide.   

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground sprayers or by aircraft using a drift control system.   

Water volume: Ground – 20 - 40 L/acre. Air – 12 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “c” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Weed control following application of clodinafop-propargyl alone or in combination with broadleaf weed herbicides can be reduced or delayed under stress conditions such as drought, heat, insufficient fertility, flooding or prolonged cool temperatures. Application under stress conditions is not recommended as it can damage the crop and weed regrowth can occur.   

## How it works   

Clodinafop-propargyl is absorbed by the leaves and is rapidly translocated to the growing points of leaves and stems. Thorough coverage of the plants is essential for consistent control.   

## Expected results   

Actively growing susceptible grasses stop growing within 48 hours of treatment. Depending on species, growing conditions and crop competition, leaves and growing points turn yellow within 1 to 3 weeks after application. Further colour changes and complete control are achieved 3 to 5 weeks after application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 30 minutes may reduce control. Grazing: Do not graze or harvest treated crops for  forage within 3 days of application. Pre-harvest intervals: Leave at least 60 days from application to harvest.   

Re-cropping: No restrictions. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

The active ingredient, clodinafop-propargyl, is highly toxic to fish. Do not apply codinafop-propargyl based  products directly to freshwater habitats.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = > 5,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Heated storage not required. If stored for 1 year or longer, shake well before using.

## Registered tank mixes   

Tank mix with glyphosate for a wider spectrum of grassy and broadleaf weed control.   

## Application information   

Water Volume: 20 - 40 L/acre by ground.   

## Application tips   

Dust on leaves can reduce efficacy.   

## How it works   

Bromoxynil provides fast, contact herbicide activity and controls Group 2 and Group 9 (glyphosate) resistant biotypes. Florasulam, an ALS inhibitor, adds additional control of weeds like hemp-nettle and narrow-leaved hawk’s-beard.   

## Expected results   

Weeds turn brown and die within 3 to 5 days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if forecasted rainfall is imminent. Grazing: Must not be grazed or fed to livestock for 30 days after treatment. Re-cropping: The following crops may be seeded the year after application: barley, brown mustard, canola, chickpea, field beans, flax, juncea canola, lentil, oriental mustard, pea, soybean, sunflower, wheat or yellow mustard. Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Runoff: Observe a 5-metre buffer zone from aquatic habitats.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 40 - 80 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “d” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

The most effective control will result from making post emergence applications early, when weeds are small. Early application to weeds results in improved weed control and makes thorough spray coverage easier to obtain. Leaf speckling, yellowing, bronzing, or burning may occur, but plants generally outgrow this condition within 10 days. New growth is normal and crop vigour is not reduced.   

## How it works   

Bentazon is a contact herbicide that interferes with photosynthesis. Acifluorfen is a Group 14 herbicide. Group 14 herbicides inhibit protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO). Cell membrane damage induced by inhibition of PPO leads to plant death.   

## Expected results   

Symptoms will appear within 1 to 2 hours of application. Leaves appear water-soaked. Cells begin to bronze and may see speckling or leaf curling. Bronzing will turn to necrosis as plants die.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 4 hours of application may reduce effectiveness. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crop or cut for hay. Re-cropping: No restrictions listed. Pre-harvest intervals: No restrictions listed.   

Re-entry interval: 48 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zones.

## Registered tank mixes   

None.   

## Application information   

Do not apply by air.   

With: Apply with power sprayer, handguns, backpack sprayer. Watering can may be used to treat small areas.   

Water volume: Fixed boom sprayer: 100 - 1,000 L/acre. Use enough water to uniformly cover the area to be treated. Handgun: 646 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

If dense growth is present, results will be improved if vegetation is removed before treatment. Do not apply closer than 1.5 times the height of nearby trees. Roots from large trees may extend well beyond the height of the tree and may extend beneath areas to be treated. Be cautious where trees are in close proximity to the treatment site.  Do not apply to brush standing in water, lawns, walks, driveways, tennis courts or similar areas. Applying, draining or flushing equipment too near feeding roots of susceptible vegetation may cause injury. Thoroughly clean all traces  of Hyvar from application equipment immediately after use.   

## How it works   

Bromacil is readily absorbed through the roots but much less readily through the leaves. Once in the plant, it  inhibits photosynthesis.   

## Expected results   

Susceptible plants become chlorotic and then die. Effects are slow to appear and may not become apparent until  the chemical has been carried into the root zone of the weeds by moisture. The degree of control and duration of effect will vary with the amount of chemical applied, soil type, rainfall and other conditions.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall required to carry the chemical into the root zone where it is absorbed. Re-entry interval: Do not enter treated area until spray has dried.   

## Environmental precautions   

Bromacil is slightly toxic to aquatic organisms, including fish. Bromacil leaches; avoid use on permeable soils.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 2,000 mg/kg.

## Application tips   

Only apply to actively growing weeds. When weeds are stressed due to frost, drought, heat or other extremes of weather at, shortly before or immediately after application, weed control may be reduced and crop injury may increase.   

## How it works   

Fluroxypyr acts as a synthetic plant hormone, causing uncontrolled plant tissue growth. The chemical is absorbed by the leaves and translocated throughout the plant. Plants become malformed and die.   

## Expected results   

Uncontrolled growth with distorted plants browning and dying.   

## Restrictions   

Pre-harvest interval: 60 days. Rainfall: Rainfast within 1 hour. Grazing: Do not cut or graze treated fields within 7 days after application. Re-cropping: Barley, canola, flax, forage grasses, lentil, mustard, oat, pea, rye or wheat can be seeded the year after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not apply fluroxypyr adjoining susceptible or non-target vegetation. Keep a 15-metre buffer between sensitive, aquatic habitats and treated areas.

## How it works   

Flucarbazone sodium is a systemic herbicide that is absorbed by both leaves and roots and moves rapidly to the growing point of the plant. Tribenuron is absorbed by foliage and roots, inhibiting cell elongation. Glyphosate is a non-selective, systemic herbicide that is absorbed through the foliage and moves through the foliage and the roots, resulting in plant mortality.   

## Expected results   

Growth of susceptible weeds stops soon after application of Inferno Duo. Symptoms of Inferno Duo include discolouration (yellowing, reddening and purpling), with complete control taking up to 1 to 2 weeks. Annual weeds susceptible to glyphosate will wilt and yellow with 2 to 4 days. Perennial weeds will wilt and yellow within 7 to 10 days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if rainfall is expected within 1 hour of application. Grazing: Do not graze treated fields  or use green crop for feed. Pre-harvest intervals: 80 days. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Re-cropping: The following crops may be planted 11 months after an application of Inferno Duo.   

Black soil zone: Barley, canola (all varieties), durum wheat, field bean, field pea*, flax, spring wheat, soybeans, sunflowers, winter wheat.   

Brown soil zone: Spring wheat, winter wheat.   

Dark Brown soil zone: Barley, canola (all varieties), durum wheat, field pea*, flax, spring wheat, soybeans, sunflowers, winter wheat.   

Grey Wooded soil zone: Barley, canola (all varieties), field pea*, spring wheat, winter wheat.   

* Field pea can be successfully grown the year following an Inferno Duo application providing the following  3 criteria are all met:   

1. Soil pH must be below 7.5.   

2. Organic matter content must be above 4%.   

3. Precipitation must be equal to or above the 10-year average (minimum 100 mm within 60 days of application in year of application).   

Rotational crops can be adversely affected if rainfall is below normal (10-year average) during the year of application. Use certified seed and good agronomic practices to reduce the effect on rotational crops.   

Inferno Duo is degraded by soil microbes; environmental conditions that decrease microbial activity must be considered when making rotational cropping decisions. These environmental conditions include prolonged drought and/or cold temperatures within the following cropping season, as well as soils with both low organic matter (less than 2%) and high pH (greater than 7.5). If these conditions exist, a soil bioassay may be necessary to ensure rotational crop safety.

## Registered tank mixes   

Glyphosate: Inferno Trio can be mixed with glyphosate at 182 g acid equivalent to 40.5 mL/acre of Inferno Trio. Weeds controlled are all of the above-listed plus weeds on the glyphosate label.   

## Application information   

Apply with: Ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 22.5 - 45 L/acre. Apply to weeds that are actively growing in the stages listed. Inferno Trio can be applied anytime between 1 week prior to planting and crop emergence.   

## Application tips   

Wheat exposed to water-logged or saturated soils, temperature extremes such as hot or cold, drought, low fertility or plant disease after application could result in unacceptable injury symptoms. Weed control may also be reduced by these same conditions, or if heavy weed infestations exist or when applications are made outside the application recommendations.   

## How it works   

Inferno Trio is absorbed by foliage and roots of grass and broadleaf weeds. These weeds cease growth soon  after application, removing the competitive effects of susceptible weeds. However, complete weed control may not be seen for 1 to 2 weeks.   

## Expected results   

Growth of susceptible plants stops soon after application. Symptoms include discolouration (yellowing, reddening and purpling) and complete control may take 1 to 2 weeks.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if it is raining or rainfall is expected within 1 hour after application. Grazing: Do not graze treated fields or use green crop for feed. Wheat grain or straw from harvested treated fields may be  fed to livestock. Pre-harvest interval: Observe minimum interval to harvest of 80 days after treatment.   

Re-cropping: The following crops may be planted 11 months after an application of Inferno Trio.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground equipment. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Wild oats herbicides require a 4 to 5 day interval before or after an application of Inferno WDG. Effectiveness may be reduced if spray mixture remains in tank for more than 24 hours. When tank mixed with Assert, apply within 12 hours of mixing.   

## How it works   

Absorbed by foliage and roots, inhibits cell elongation.   

## Expected results   

Inferno WDG stops growth of susceptible weeds immediately. However, typical symptoms (discolouration) of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility. Degree of control and duration of effect depend on weed sensitivity, weed size, spray coverage and growing conditions. Favorable growing conditions following treatment promote the activity of Inferno WDG while cold, dry conditions delay the activity.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Inferno WDG requires 4 to 6 hours of dry weather to be absorbed by weed foliage. Grazing: Do not graze or feed to livestock within 30 days of application. Pre-harvest interval: A minimum of 2 months should be left between the application of this product and harvest. Re-cropping: The following crops can be seeded 2 months after application: canola, flax, lentil and alfalfa. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

The active ingredient, tribenuron-methyl, is considered to be toxic to many plants and non-toxic to fish, aquatic invertebrates, soil micro- and macro-organisms, birds, mammals and insects.

These are with Tilt, Sevin XLR and MCPA ester on spring, winter and durum wheat and barley; spring, durum wheat and barley with Lontrel, Puma Advance + Tilt, and Decis; Horizon NG, Traxos and Traxos + Tilt in spring and durum wheat; Axial + Tilt with spring wheat and barley. Luxxur in spring, winter and durum wheat. Apply mixes according to the most restrictive use limitations for either product.   

## Application information   

Apply with ground sprayers or by air. Water volume: Ground: minimum of 18.9 L/acre. Air: minimum of 11.3 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Half fill tank with water; use continuous agitation. If mixing with AMS, add to the tank first. Add Infinity, then add tank mix partner, then fill tank. Maintain agitation through mixing and application.   

## Application tips   

Under cool and/or dry conditions, activity may be reduced or delayed. Weed control may also be reduced if application is made when weeds are dust covered or in the presence of heavy dew, fog, mist or rain. If crop is under stress due to abnormal environmental conditions, delay application until stress passes and after both crop and weeds have resumed active growth. Apply only once per season.   

## How it works   

Pyrasulfotole is absorbed through leaves and is translocated to meristematic regions where it inhibits the HPPD enzyme. Pyrasulfotole inhibits plant pigment biosynthesis and photosynthesis.   

## Expected results   

Small burnt spots on the broadleaf weeds can appear in hours. Lack of plant pigments shuts down the photosynthetic pathway, resulting in bleaching symptoms and rapid death, normally in 6 to 14 days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour of application may reduce effectiveness. Grazing: Do not graze treated perennial ryegrass, red fescue or bromegrass crops within 7 days of application or harvest for hay within 30 days of application. Do not graze other treated crops or cut for forage or hay within 25 days of application.   

Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest wheat or triticale for grain or straw within 50 days of application. Do not harvest barley for grain or straw within 45 days of application. Re-entry interval: 24 hours. Re-cropping: Alfalfa, barley, canary seed, canola, flax, (including low linolenic acid varieties) field pea*, tame oats, spring wheat including durum, potato and sunflower may be planted 10 months after application. Lentil can be grown 22 months after application.   

* Field pea may be grown the year following Infinity application in all Black, Gray Wooded and Dark Brown soil zones. Do not plant field pea the year following Infinity application in the Brown soil zone where organic matter content is less than 2.5% and soil pH is above 7.5. Use a field bioassay for crops not listed above.   

## Environmental precautions   

Infinity contains distillates that are toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Avoid contamination of aquatic systems during applications. This product moves in water and is a possible leaching problem in coarse soils or where the water table is shallow.   

## Toxicity   

Pyrasulfotole is practically non-toxic to wild mammals, birds, fish and aquatic invertebrates, earthworms and bees and does not negatively affect soil microorganisms. Infinity is toxic to aquatic plants and non-target terrestrial plants.   

## Storage   

Do not store at temperatures below -20°C. If stored for 1 year or longer, shake well before using.

## Herbicides   

Purchase the printed edition of Crop Protection 2023 for only $15. Buy it on-line here.   

back to Table of Contents   

## How it works   

Pyrasulfotole is absorbed through leaves and is translocated to meristematic regions where it inhibits the HPPD enzyme. Pyrasulfotole inhibits plant pigment biosynthesis and photosynthesis. Fluroxypyr is also absorbed by the leaves, and it mimics naturally occurring plant hormones and controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms include twisting of stems and swollen nodes. Bromoxynil inhibits respiration and photosynthesis causing death.   

## Expected results   

For best results, apply to emerged, young, actively growing weeds according to the weed stages listed. Under stressed conditions and/or heavy crop canopy, early application will result in improved weed control. Weeds growing under adverse environmental conditions such as drought will be less susceptible to herbicide effects.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour may reduce control. Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Grazing: Do not graze treated crops or cut for hay within 25 days of application. Pre-harvest intervals: Leave at least 60 days application to harvest for wheat, durum and barley. Re-cropping: The year after application, alfalfa, barley, canary seed, canola, flax, potato, sunflower, oats and wheat (durum and spring) may be seeded. Field pea may be seeded the season following application in the Black, Grey Wooded, and Dark Brown soil zones. Do not plant field pea the season following Infinity use in the Brown Soil zone where organic matter us below 2.5% and where soil pH is above 7.5. Lentils may be seeded the second season after application.   

## Environmental precautions   

Use the same precautions and buffers as Infinity.

Inadequate coverage of target weeds, improper application technique and/or application to mature, large (taller than 12.5 cm), stressed or mown weeds will usually result in unacceptable weed control.   

## Mixing instructions   

Apply products in the following order: Insight 339SC Herbicide – glyphosate- spray adjuvant.   

## How it works   

Non-selective contact PPO inhibitor. Readily absorbed by green plant tissue leading to cell membrane destruction.   

## Expected results   

Rapid burndown of emerged plants. Chlorosis and necrotic symptoms usually develop within hours after application and death of susceptible weeds occurs within a few days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast in 1 hour. Grazing: Do not use where grazing is planned. Re-cropping: Corn/wheat – 0 days after application, soybeans – 14 days after application. All other crops – 270 days after application.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe specified spray buffer zones. The use of this product in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow, may result in ground water contamination. To reduce runoff from treated areas into aquatic habitats avoid application to areas with a moderate to steep slope, compacted soil or clay. Contamination of aquatic areas because of runoff may be reduced by including a vegetative filter strip between the treated area and the edge of the water body.

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “e” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Effectiveness may be reduced if spray mixture remains in the tank for more than 24 hours. It is essential to get good plant coverage. Extremes in environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, soil conditions and cultural practices may affect activity. Under very dry conditions, symptoms may be reduced as weeds are less susceptible to herbicide. Intruvix can be applied only 1 time per growing season.   

## How it works   

Stops the growth of susceptible weeds immediately. It is rapidly absorbed by foliage and roots, inhibits cell elongation and disrupts metabolism. Also inhibits the PPO enzyme involved in chlorophyll and heme synthesis. This action results in leaky cell membranes and rapid browning and death. Degree of control and duration of effect depend on weed sensitivity, weed size, spray coverage and growing conditions.   

## Expected results   

Initial symptoms will be observed within a few days followed by death.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: If rain occurs soon after application, control may be reduced. Environmental conditions that slow the drying of the spray mixture on the foliage may increase the time required for absorption. Re-cropping: Wheat (spring, durum, winter), barley or oats can be seeded a minimum of 24 hours after application. Chemfallow applications can be seeded to any crop the following season. Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Overspray or drift should be avoided. Do not contaminate irrigation water. Toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Observe a 5-metre buffer zone from any sensitive habitat without the use of drift control aids.

Glyphosate at a rate of 180 - 360 g ae per acre   

## Application information   

How to Apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Good growing conditions promote weed growth and enhance the activity of Revenge Pro. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be controlled. Insufficient water volumes or coarse sprays may also reduce control levels.   

## How it works   

Carfentrazone is a contact herbicide. 2,4-D is a systemic, non-selective herbicide readily absorbed through leaves or roots. Accumulation is primarily in the young, rapidly growing meristematic regions of roots or shoots. It inhibits pigments, including chlorophyll, leading to death.   

## Expected results   

Initial symptoms such as browning, wilting, and necrosis appear very rapidly (hours to a few days). Susceptible plants become malformed before they die. Complete death occurs within a few days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rain within 2 hours of application may reduce weed control. Grazing: Do not allow lactating dairy animals to graze within 7 days of application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields 3 days before slaughter.   

Re-cropping: No rotational restrictions the year after application. Pre-harvest intervals: 30 days.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

To reduce runoff from treated areas into aquatic habitats, avoid application to areas with moderate to steep slope, bare soil, compacted soil or clay. The use of 2,4-D may result in contamination of groundwater, particularly in areas where soils are permeable (e.g., sandy soil) and/or the depth to the water table is shallow.

## Application tips   

Korrex ll/Pilot tank mix with glyphosate herbicides, controls weeds prior to seeding spring wheat (including durum), spring barley, winter wheat and oats. Korrex II can be applied in the fall or spring prior to planting, or as an initial treatment in summerfallow. Warm, moist growing conditions enhance the activity of Korrex II/Pilot by allowing maximum foliar uptake and contact activity. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed, and re-growth may occur. For best results, ensure thorough spray coverage of target weeds. Reduced control may also occur when applied to weeds heavily covered in dust. Fall stubble: Korrex II can be applied until late October, but active weed growth must be present.   

## How it works   

Florasulam is absorbed through leaves and stops growth of susceptible weeds rapidly via inhibition of the ALS enzyme. Dicamba is absorbed through roots and leaves and translocated through the phloem and xylem, disrupting plant metabolism.   

## Expected results   

Weeds susceptible to florasulam will stop growing almost immediately. Newer leaves start to yellow and wilt, followed by a loss of green colour. Symptoms will spread to the rest of the plant with some weeds showing purpling or reddening. Under good growing conditions, complete control may occur within 7 to 10 days after application. Weeds susceptible to dicamba will exhibit proliferation of tissues in plant causing twisting and bending of stem and leaf petioles, cupping of leaves, increased size of root and increase in fibrous roots. Results may take 10 to 14 days to appear.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Product is rainfast in 30 minutes. Grazing: Livestock may be grazed on treated crops 7 days following application of Korrex. Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days of application. Withdraw meat animals from treated field at least 30 days before slaughter. Re-cropping: The year following Korrex application, fields can be seeded to alfalfa, barley, mustard, canola, chickpea, faba bean, field bean, flax, lentil, pea, soybean, sunflower, wheat, corn, oats and potato or summerfallowed. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

A buffer zone of 30 metres is required between sprayed area and sensitive habitat.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 2,629 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Store in original containers in secure, dry storage area. Do not allow contamination of seeds, plants, fertilizers or other pesticides. Do not contaminate food, feedstuffs or domestic water supplies. If containers are damaged or  spill occurs, use the product immediately or contain the spill with absorbent materials and dispose of waste.

## Application information   

With: Boom spray, handgun, backpack or sprinkling can. Do not apply by air. Water volume: Minimum of 20 L/kg of Krovar 1. Use enough water to uniformly cover area to be treated.   

## Application tips   

During spraying, Krovar 1 must be kept in suspension at all times by continuous agitation. Sufficient moisture from rainfall or artificial means is necessary after treatment to carry the chemical into the root zone of the weeds. If dense growth is present, results will be improved if vegetation is removed before treatment. Do not apply when ground is frozen. Do not treat ditches, wellheads, bridge approaches. Do not treat sites that are adjacent to and surrounding water supply reservoirs, supply streams, lakes and ponds.   

## How it works   

Krovar 1 is readily absorbed through the roots, leaves and stems.   

## Expected results   

Plants become chlorotic and then die. The degree of control and duration of effect will vary with the amount of chemical applied, soil type, rainfall and other factors. Poor results occur if weeds are too mature or if insufficient rainfall.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall needed to move the chemical to the root zone. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crops or cut  for hay; sufficient data are not available to support such use. Re-entry interval: Do not enter treated area until spray has dried.   

## Environmental precautions   

Krovar I is toxic to aquatic organisms. Do not apply directly or indirectly to aquatic habitats. Use a buffer zone of  15 metres from sprayed area and sensitive habitat.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application for Liberty 150 SN/Vigor/Interline. Water volume: Ground: 45 L/acre minimum. Air: 22 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

For best results, apply to emerged, young actively growing weeds. Weeds that emerge after application will not  be controlled. When a rate range is given, the higher rate should be used: (1) when weed or crop growth is dense, (2) when the weeds are large and/or mature (i.e., advanced leaf stages and plant height, and (3) when environmental conditions are cool and dry.   

## How it works   

Liberty/MPower Vigor/Interline works primarily as a contact herbicide. Thorough coverage of the weeds to be controlled is essential. Absorbed by all leaf and stem surfaces. It interferes with plants’ ability to detoxify ammonia. The speed of action of Liberty/MPower Vigor/Interline is influenced by environmental factors. At cool temperatures (below 10°C), poor moisture and low humidity, speed of action may be reduced.   

## Expected results   

Generally, visual symptoms appear 2 to 4 days after application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: If rainfall occurs within 4 hours of application, effectiveness may be reduced. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crop or cut for hay; sufficient data are not available to support such use. Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

Re-cropping: There are no cropping restrictions for field corn, canola, soybean, dry common bean (not grown for seed), alfalfa and potato. 70 days for buckwheat, barley, millet, oats, rye, sorghum, triticale and wheat. 120 days for all other crops. Pre-harvest intervals: Liberty + Centution/Select – 60 days. Liberty + Facet L – 60 days.   

## Environmental precautions   

Highly toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Do not contaminate surface or ground water. Use a 15-metre buffer, with ground spraying, between the treated area and sensitive habitat.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 2,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Do not store below freezing. If stored for 1 year or longer, shake well before using.

For season long control of top growth of Canada thistle, apply Clobber/Advantage Clopyraild/FBN Clopyralid/CT Mix 360 at the rate of 227 mL/acre or Lontrel XC at 138 mL/acre. This rate will generally provide season long control of Canada thistle. Not all rhizomes will be killed and some re-growth may occur by the end of the growing season.   

For season long control of top growth, with a reduction of Canada thistle population in the following year, apply Clobber/Advantage Clopyraild/FBN Clopyralid/CT Mix 360 at the rate of 336 mL/acre or Lontrel XC at  202 mL/acre. This rate will provide season long control of Canada thistle and suppression into the following season, resulting in a reduction of the total number of Canada thistle shoots in the treated area.

Note: Do not use 2,4-D on oats due to the probability of crop injury.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 40 - 80 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Do not use products containing 2,4-D on oats due to probability of crop injury. Rates of MCPA ester of 170 grams active ingredients/acre or higher or MCPA amine of 200 grams active ingredient/acre may cause some delay in maturity of flax, resulting in yield reduction. Make sure the sprayer tank has been thoroughly cleaned before Lontrel XC/Pyralid is mixed. Treat crops during warm weather when weeds are actively growing. Best results are obtained when Canada thistle is actively growing and soil moisture is adequate for rapid growth. Under cool or dry conditions, control of Canada thistle may be severely reduced. Sow thistle plants emerging after spraying will not be controlled. Where contact herbicides are used, such as bromoxynil, that damage the leaves of the Canada thistle, apply Lontrel XC/Pyralid 14 days prior or after an interval of 14 days, which allows Canada thistle to recover and resume growth.   

Forage grasses: For control of the weeds listed on the label plus alsike clover, apply Pyralid at the rate of  170 - 336 mL/acre (101 - 202 mL/acre Lontrel XC) in 45 - 90 L/acre of water. Make 1 application per season  by ground sprayer. For seedling grasses, apply at the 3-leaf stage and beyond. For established grasses, apply in  the fall after harvest or early spring.   

## How it works   

Clopyralid is a systemic, hormone-type herbicide. It is absorbed by leaf and stem surfaces and is readily translocated. Maximum efficacy results from foliar application to young actively growing plants.   

## Expected results   

Herbicide symptoms on affected plants include swollen growing points and roots, cupping of leaves, twisted and distorted stems and leaves. Plants will gradually stop growing and change colour, first to dark green and then to yellow before turning brown as they die. Maximum effectiveness results from foliar applications to young actively growing plants. Death of weeds may not occur until 14 to 21 days after application. With the lowest rate of Lontrel on Canada thistle, some regrowth may occur by the end of the season, but this will not interfere with harvesting of the crop.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: A rain-free period of 4 to 6 hours after application is required. Grazing: There are no restrictions on the grazing of crops or forages treated with Lontrel XC/Pyralid. If necessary, treated areas may be grazed immediately following application. Pre-harvest intervals: Sugar beets – do not apply within 90 days of harvest. Strawberry –P.H.I. = 200 days. Re-cropping: Fields treated with Lontrel can be seeded to barley, canola, forage grasses, flax, mustard, oats, rye, wheat or summerfallowed. Do not seed to crops other than those listed above for at least 1 year after treatment. If severe drought conditions are experienced during the months of June to August inclusive (less than 14 cm rainfall) in the year of application, delay seeding soybeans and field peas an additional 12 months (total 22 months following application). Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Use of straw and manure from treated crops: Lontrel XC/Pyralid residues in straw may be harmful to susceptible plants. Do not use straw from treated crops for composting or mulching on susceptible broadleaf crops. Manure can be spread on fields that will be seeded to barley, flax, oats, canola (rapeseed), rye or wheat. Do not grow susceptible crops such as pea, bean, lentil, potato, sunflower or other sensitive crops on land that has been mulched with straw containing Lontrel/Pyralid residues within the last 12 months.   

## Environmental precautions   

Small amounts of drift may damage sensitive plants such as legumes.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = > 2,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Store in heated storage. If frozen, warm slowly to room temperature and mix thoroughly before use.

## Application information   

With: Ground equipment. Water volume: Potato – 120 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Do not use on sandy or coarse-textured soils, low in organic matter, as crop injury may result. Do not use when crops are under drought stress. Closed mixing/loading systems are required. During application,  use a closed cab that provides both a physical barrier and respiratory protection (such as dust/mist filtering and/or vapour/gas purification system). The closed cab must have a chemical-resistant barrier that totally surrounds the occupant and prevents contact with pesticides outside the cab.   

## How it works   

A systemic herbicide absorbed by leaves and roots. Yellowing (chlorosis), stunting and finally death occurs  10 to 14 days after treatment.   

## Expected results   

Weeds: Yellowing starts 7 to 10 days after application. Effect greatest under excellent growing conditions.  Weed control will vary depending on species, time of application and growing conditions. Crop: A slight yellowing of crop, leaf tip and leaf margin burn may be seen 7 to 10 days after application. Crop recovers within 14 to 18 days. Crop injury can occur if applied during period of high heat.

## Restrictions   

Limit the amount of product handled per day to 77 kg a.i. per person for groundboom application when mixing, loading and applying. Rainfall: Heavy rainfall within 2 hours may decrease activity. Pre-emergent treatment requires rainfall or irrigation for activation. Carrots or potatoes may be severely injured if unusually heavy rains follow application. Grazing: Do not graze or cut for hay; there are not sufficient data available to support such use. Re-cropping: With the exception of a stand failure do not plant carrots, parsnips and potatoes within 12 months of a previous application of Lorox L herbicide. Do not replant treated areas to other crops within 4 months after last application (or as otherwise directed) as injury to subsequent crops may result.   

Re-entry interval/Pre-harvest interval/Buffer zones: Depends on crop and activity. Refer to label for specific details.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and air. Water volume: Cereals, flax, pastures, forage grasses – 40 L/acre. Peas – minimum  of 61 L/acre. Pasture, rangeland and turf – 180 L/acre. Cereals underseeded to legumes – 61 - 81 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Best weed control occurs when daytime temperatures are above 21°C and nighttime temperatures are at 10°C.  Do not spray when air temperature is above 27°C. Extremely hard water may reduce performance.  When applying to flax under hot and humid conditions, some crop injury and delay in maturity may result. Spraying in the evening and/or increased volumes of water (40 or more L/acre) may reduce the risk of flax injury.   

## How it works   

A systemic, absorbed by leaf and stem surfaces and translocated to the actively growing regions. MCPA disrupts  cell division, causing abnormal growth response, thereby affecting respiration and food reserves.   

## Expected results   

Weeds start to twist between 2 to 20 days after spraying, depending on weather conditions, formulation and nature of weeds. Following the twisting and bending, plants will turn brown, and then die. Only emerged weeds will be controlled.

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rain within 6 hours of MCPA Na salt, or MCPA K-salt, 4 hours of MCPA amine, and 2 hours of MCPA ester application will decrease weed control. Grazing: Do not graze or cut for green feed until 7 days after spraying.   

Re-cropping: No restrictions the year after application. Re-entry interval: Do not enter treated area until spray has dried.   

## Environmental precautions   

MCPA is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants and can readily leach in the soil.   

## Toxicity   

Moderate acute mammalian toxicity.   

## Storage   

If frozen, warm to 5°C and mix well before using.

## Application information   

W   

ith: Ground equipment only. Do not apply by air.   

Water volume: Cereals – 80 - 120 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Recommended water volume is essential for optimum weed control. Cold weather and drought may cause a delay  in weed control action.   

## How it works   

A systemic that disrupts the plant’s translocation system causing the accumulation of plant food in the shoots and subsequent starvation of the roots.   

## Expected results   

## Weeds:   

   

Leaf curling and stem twisting should be visible within 4 to 5 days after spraying. Weeds should be dead within 3 to 4 weeks of application. Crop: Deformed heads, missing florets and twisted awns could result if recommendations are not followed or if crop is under stress conditions.

## Application tips   

Best results are obtained when Momentum is applied to actively growing weeds in the seedling stage and when Canada thistle is between 10 cm and up to but not including the early bud stage. Poor weed control may result  under cool or dry conditions. Recommended boom height must be 60 cm or less above the crop or ground.   

## How it works   

Momentum is comprised of chemistries from the Group 4 herbicide group. When applied, it will move within the plant to control exposed and underground plant tissue. It mimics naturally occurring plant hormones and controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms include twisting of stems and swollen nodes.   

## Expected results   

Weeds will start to twist shortly after being sprayed. The plants will continue to twist and bend, stop growing and eventually turn brown and die. When applied to more difficult to control weeds such as Canada thistle and wild buckwheat, the plants will stop growing but change colour more to a dark green and then yellow. Death may not occur for 14 to 21 days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if rain is expected within 6 hours. Grazing: Livestock may graze on treated crops 3 days following application. However, review all chemistries in the tank mix: follow the most restrictive label for determining when livestock can be grazed on treated crop. Pre-harvest interval: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application. Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Momentum can be seeded the following year to wheat, barley, oats and rye (not underseeded to forage legumes, clover or alfalfa), canola, flax, mustard, field pea, or fields can be summerfallowed. Seed only those crops listed in the year following treatment.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Note: do not seed field peas for at least 10 months following treatment. Very dry soil conditions following application can result in a risk of injury to field peas grown in rotation. If severe drought conditions are experienced during the months of June to August inclusive in the year of application, delay seeding field peas an additional 12 months (total 22 months following application). Contact the local Loveland Products representative or retailer for more information before seeding field pea following drought conditions in the previous year.   

## Environmental precautions   

Avoid contamination of aquatic systems during application as Momentum contains petroleum distillate, which is moderately to highly toxic to aquatic organisms. Observe buffer zones as outlined on the label.

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground sprayers. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Good growing conditions enhance the activity of Muster following maximum foliar uptake and contact activity. Weed regrowth may occur in thin stands and where crops suffer from reduced vigour and under poor growing conditions. Apply before the crop canopy prevents thorough coverage of the small target weeds.   

## How it works   

Absorbed by foliage and roots. Inhibits cell elongation.   

## Expected results   

Muster is an ALS inhibitor herbicide and thus rapidly inhibits the growth of susceptible weeds; however, typical symptoms (discolouration) of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application depending upon growing conditions and weed susceptibility. Degree of control and duration of effect depend on weed sensitivity, weed size, growing conditions, and spray coverage. Regrowth may occur if crop competitiveness is impaired by thin stands and/or reduced vigour or if weeds have hardened off from cold weather or drought.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall 4 to 6 hours after application may reduce effectiveness. Environmental conditions that slow  the drying of Muster on the foliage, such as high relative humidity, cool air temperature or cloud cover, may  increase the time required. Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Grazing: Do not graze or feed crop to livestock within 60 days of treatment. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest within 60 days of treatment. Re-cropping: See chart below.   

## 10 months   

Spring wheat, durum wheat, barley, oats, flax   

## 22 months   

Canola, lentil, pea, faba bean, tame mustard, alfalfa, canary grass, dry bean, fescue, red clover   

## All other crops, field bioassay at 22 months to ensure no carryover damage   

Wherever Muster is used on land previously treated with Ally herbicide, read the rotational guidelines on both labels and follow the label with the longest interval stated for your situation.   

## Environmental precautions   

Muster Toss-N-Go is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Muster is water soluble and  mobile in the soil.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) > 5,000 mg/kg.

Common crupina (Crupina vulgaris), Iberian starthistle (Centaurea iberica) , South African ragwort (Senecio inaequidens), yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis)   

## Application information   

How to Apply: Ground or aerial application. Water Volume: Ground – Broadleaf weeds – 80 L/acre. Brush species – 202 L/acre. Brush/woody plants up to 2.5 metres in height (unless otherwise indicated) – up to 810 L/ac.  Aerial – 12-20 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

For best results, applications of Navius should be made when brush species and weeds are actively growing. Complete coverage of all foliage and stems is required for brush control. Applications should be made after the  target species have leafed out, but before fall colouration has begun. Do not treat brush species that exceed 2.5 metre in height (unless otherwise indicated) or control may be decreased. Apply to brush species as a full coverage spray to foliage and stems using equipment that will ensure uniform coverage.   

## How it works   

The most noticeable symptom is a bending and twisting of stems and leaves. Other advanced symptoms include severe chlorosis, necrosis, stem thickening, growth stunting, leaf crinkling, calloused stems and leaf veins, leaf-cupping and enlarged roots.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Navius FLEX/TruRange - rainfast in 4 hours. Grazing: There are no grazing or haying restrictions for non-lactating or lactating animals (including cattle, horses, sheep, and goats) when products are used as directed. Grazing animals do not have to be moved off the pasture or rangeland before, during or after applying these products. Aminocyclopyrachlor passes through an animal’s digestive tract and is excreted in urine and manure at levels that may cause injury to susceptible plants. Do not transfer grazed animals from areas treated with Navius FLEX/TruRange to areas where sensitive crops occur without first allowing 3 days of grazing on untreated areas.   

Re-cropping: If rangeland or pasture or non-crop sites treated with Navius FLEX/TruRange are to be converted to a food, feed or fiber agricultural crop, or to a horticultural crop, a field bioassay should be completed before planting the desired crop. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants including coniferous and deciduous trees. Observe buffer zones specified on the product labels.

## Application information   

Apply with ground equipment only. Water volume:10 gallons/acre (40 L/acre).   

## Application tips   

Early application is critical; weeds must be emerged but less than 4-leaf stage for optimum control. Use higher water volumes for dense weed populations and thick crop canopies.   

## How it works   

Imazamox 35% + Imazethapyr 35% component is absorbed by foliage and roots and disrupts plant metabolism causing growth to stop. Clethodim is a systemic herbicide that translocates from treated foliage to the growing points of leaves, shoots and roots, causing growth to stop within 48 hours and causing plant yellowing and death within several weeks.   

## Expected results   

Typical symptoms (yellow striping and discolouration at the growing point) may not be noticeable for several days to 2 weeks. Do not apply if temperatures of 5˚C or lower are forecast within 3 days of application. Crop injury or yellowing may occur if using when cold. Crop injury or poor weed control may occur when plants are stressed. The Imazamox + Imazethapyr component can be persistent in soil, especially under drought, extremes in soil pH and excessive cold. Do not grow Liberty Link® or Roundup Ready® canola the year after application of Ninja Master.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: 3 hours. Grazing: Treated fields may be fed to livestock 30 days after application. Do not harvest forage or cut hay for forage. Harvest treated crops 60 days of application. Re-cropping: 1 year after application – barley, canary seed, chickpeas, Group 2 tolerant® canola, Group 2 tolerant lentil, durum wheat, field pea, spring wheat,

tame oats. Conduct a field bioassay the year before growing any crop other than those listed above. For the Peace River region, wait a minimum of 3 years and perform a field bioassay prior to planting canola.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to non-target terrestrial and aquatic plants. Observe buffer zones on component product labels.   

Runoff: Prevent runoff into susceptible area. Leaching: Leaching may occur in areas where soils are permeable (e.g., sandy soil) and/or the depth to the water table is shallow.

## Application tips   

Apply Nortron before or at planting time and incorporate into the soil to a depth of 2.5 - 5 cm. Deeper incorporation may reduce effectiveness. Nortron may be applied pre-emergence at the time of planting or shortly after, but prior to weed emergence.   

Incorporation equipment: Hooded-power or ground-driven rotary tillers, rolling cultivators and harrows are most effective for incorporating Nortron into the soil. Do not apply Nortron through soil injector shanks. All existing vegetative growth should be thoroughly worked into the soil before treatment. Do not allow spray mixture to stand  in tank overnight.   

## How it works   

Uptake of ethofumesate occurs primarily via the emerging shoot as it passes upwards through treated soil. However, for certain broadleaf species, root uptake is more important. Ethofumesate is non-volatile, and in all cases, uptake occurs from aqueous solution.   

## Expected results   

Ethofumesate applied pre-plant incorporated with proper activation will normally not permit weed emergence.  If emergence should occur, uptake has occurred; seedling will show loss of vigour and eventual death.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Normally 1.5 cm of rainfall is sufficient to activate Nortron. In areas where moisture can be marginal, incorporation is recommended. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crops or cut for hay; there are not sufficient data available to support such use. Re-cropping: Do not rotate with any crops other than sugar beets for 12 months  after application. Thorough tillage should precede the planting of crops other than sugar beets. If crop is lost  due to climatic or soil conditions following application of Nortron, do not plant crops other than sugar beets in Nortron-treated land during the same season. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Do not retreat field with Nortron. Wheat and barley may be injured if planted following a dry sugar beet year.   

## Environmental precautions   

Nortron/Etho SC is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target plants. Observe buffer zones of 1 metre for  sensitive habitats.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) > 2,100 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Do not use or store near heat or open flames. Store Nortron in a cool place, above 0°C.

## Application information   

How to Apply: Ground or aerial application. Water Volume: Ground – 20 - 40 L/acre. Aerial – 12 - 20 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Herbicide activity is influenced by weather. Optimum activity requires active crop and weed growth. Temperature range for best results will be 8   

0   

C to 24   

0   

C. Frost 72 hours before or after application many reduce weed control and crop tolerance.   

## How it works   

Systemic broadleaf herbicide activity. When applied to foliage the components move within the plant to control above and below ground plant tissues. It mimics naturally occurring plant hormones and controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms include twisting of stems and swollen nodes.   

## Expected results   

Broadleaf weeds start to twist shortly after application. After twisting and bending, plants stop growing, turn brown and die.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if rainfall is expected within 1 hour. Grazing: Do not permit lactating dairy cows to graze fields within 7 days of application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields 3 days prior to slaughter   

Re-cropping: Fields treated with OcTTain XL herbicide can be seeded the following year to alfalfa, barley, corn, dry beans, canola, flax, forage grasses, lentils, mustard, oats, pea, potato, rye, soybean, sugar beet, sunflower and wheat.   

Pre-harvest Intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application. Do not harvest forage or cut for hay within 30 days after application. Re-entry interval: 12-hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms, birds, small wild mammals and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe the largest (most restrictive) buffer zone on label between the point of application and the closest downwind side of sensitive habitat. Avoid sites with characteristics which could lead to run-off or leaching (sandy soil or shallow water table).   

## Toxicity   

Fluroxypyr: Acute oral LD50   

= >2000 mg/kg. 2,4-D: Acute oral LD50   

= technical 639-764 mg/kg.

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground equipment only. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Water soluble bags will dissolve better when kept intact; do not split bags. If agitation is stopped for more than 5 minutes, re-suspend spray solution by full agitation prior to commencing spraying again. Do not spray Odyssey/Duet/Ninja if temperatures of 5oC or lower are forecasted within 3 days of application. Temperatures near freezing (below 5ºC) will prevent optimum herbicide performance, as weeds are not actively growing. Initial transient crop yellowing may be observed after application, but this is outgrown and should not affect yield. Use 50 mesh or coarser filter screens.   

## How it works   

Absorbed by foliage and roots. Disrupts plant metabolism causing growth to stop. Works best under good growing conditions. Residual activity of small seeded, shallow germinating flushing weeds (not wild oats) expected until crop flowering. Moist conditions result in better residual control.

## Expected results   

Susceptible weeds stop growing within 24 to 48 hours. Yellow striping and purplish or reddish discolouration of the leaves may occur. Leaves begin to die in 3 to 10 days starting with the youngest and moving to the older leaves. Death of the plant may occur in 1 to 3 weeks.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if rain is expected in 3 hours. Grazing: Do not graze treated XCEED canola or  cut for hay; sufficient data are not available to support such uses. Field pea treated with Odyssey/Duet/Ninja  may be fed to livestock 30 days after application. Pre-harvest intervals: After 60 days, bird’s-foot trefoil, canola, field pea, fenugreek (for seed uses only) and lentils can be harvested. Only apply Odyssey/Duet/Ninja once per year.   

Re-cropping (Odyssey/Odyssey NXT only): Barley, CLEARFIELD canola, chickpea, field corn, field pea, lentil (including CLEARFIELD lentils), oats, soybean, spring wheat and XCEED can be grown safely the year following an application. Canary Seed and durum wheat may be grown safely 2 years following an Odyssey application. Research studies have shown that flax, non-CLEARFIELD tolerant canola and non-CLEARFIELD tolerant sunflower may be safely planted 2 years following an Odyssey application in all regions of Western Canada except the Peace River Region of Alberta and British Columbia. In the Peace River Region, wait a minimum of 3 years and perform a field bioassay the year prior to planting non-CLEARFIELD canola. WARNING:  Certain environmental conditions may delay the breakdown of herbicide residues in soil.  These conditions include but are not limited to drought, extremes in soil pH (less than 6.5), low organic matter soils (less than 3%), extremely coarse textured (sandy) soils, and excessive cold.  Under these conditions, the level of phytotoxic herbicide residues present in the field the season following an application may result in an increased potential for injury to succeeding crops to occur.  This potential for increased residues under these environmental conditions is not unique to any specific herbicide or herbicide group but is a property of those herbicides which persist in the soil and are dependent on soil microbial activity and other non-microbial processes (e.g. hydrolysis) to breakdown.   

If drought conditions are experienced between June 1 and September 1 in the year of application, delay planting of tame oats by an additional year.  If drought conditions are experienced between June 1 and September 1 in the year of application, OR between June 1 and September 1 in the year following application, delay planting of canola (non-Clearfield) by an additional year.   

In the grey, black, and dark brown soil zones, drought is defined as less than 125 mm of total precipitation between June 1 and September 1.  In the brown soil zone, drought is defined as less than 125 mm of total precipitation between June 1 and September 1, OR less than 15 mm of precipitation in any month between June 1 and September 1.   

For other crops, call BASF at 1-877-371-2273. Conduct a field bioassay the year before growing any crops other than those listed above. In case of crop failure, replant only to CLEARFIELD tolerant canola or field pea. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Odyssey/Duet/Ninja is highly toxic to non-target plants. A buffer zone of 14 metres is required between sprayed area and sensitive habitat.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 5,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Store at temperatures above 5°C. Keep unused water soluble bags in resealed, original container. Keep packages  dry at all times.

## Application tips   

Use 50 mesh or coarser filter screens. Do not spray Odyssey Ultra if temperatures of 5ºC or lower are forecast within 3 days of application. Apply when weeds are small and actively growing. Initial transient crop yellowing may be observed after application, but this is outgrown and should not affect yield.   

## How it works   

Absorbed by foliage and roots. Disrupts plant metabolism causing growth to stop. Residual activity of Odyssey component on small seeded, shallow germinating flushing weeds (not wild oats) expected until crop flowering. Moist conditions result in better residual control.   

## Expected results   

Odyssey causes susceptible weeds to stop growing within 24 to 48 hours. Yellow striping and purplish or reddish discolouration of the leaves may occur. Leaves begin to die in 3 to 10 days starting with the youngest and moving to the older leaves. Death of the plant may occur in 1 to 3 weeks. Caziva is a systemic herbicide that causes growth to cease within 48 hours. Young leaves will turn yellow within 5 to 10 days and some grasses will then turn reddish.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast in 3 hours. Grazing: Field peas may be fed to livestock 30 days after application. Do not graze treated soybeans or cut for hay; sufficient data is not available to support these uses. Re-cropping: Barley, CLEARFIELD canola, chickpea, field corn, field pea, lentil (including CLEARFIELD lentils), oats, soybean, spring wheat and XCEED can be grown safely the year following an application. Canary seed and durum wheat may be grown safely 2 years following an Odyssey application.   

Research studies have shown that flax, non-CLEARFIELD tolerant canola and non-CLEARFIELD tolerant sunflower may be safely planted 2 years following Odyssey applications in all regions of Western Canada except the Peace River Region of Alberta and British Columbia.

## Application tips   

Do not apply during periods of dead calm or when winds are gusty. Do not apply with spray droplets smaller than the American Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE S572.1) coarse classification. Boom height must be 60 cm or less above the crop or ground.   

## How it works   

Paradigm PRE is a mixture of a systemic auxin-type herbicide (Group 4) and an ALS enzyme inhibitor-type herbicide (Group 2). The product controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns and/or by inhibiting production of the enzyme essential for production of certain amino acids essential for plant growth.   

## Expected Results   

Weeds start to twist between 2 to 20 days after spraying, dependent on weather conditions and nature of weeds. Following twisting and bending, plants will turn brown and die.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Applications are rain fast within 1 hour of application. Grazing: Livestock may be grazed on treated crops 7 days following application. Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Paradigm PRE can be seeded after a minimum of 10 months to alfalfa, spring wheat, spring barley, canola, faba bean, field corn, flax, Juncea canola, field pea, potato (except seed potato), oriental, brown and yellow mustard, soybean, oats, sunflower or dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris species including pinto, kidney and white types). Lentils can be planted 22 months after application of Exhilarate. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application.  Do not cut the treated crop for hay or silage within 21 days after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions:   

Toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zone of 1 metre between terrestrial and water habitats.

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground equipment or by air in wheat and barley only. Water volume: Ground – Corn –  80 - 120 L/acre. All other crops – 40 L/acre. Aerial – wheat and barley only - 8 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Avoid spraying crops during adverse growing conditions, especially drought, high temperatures (>29°C) or  in high humidity.   

## How it works   

A contact herbicide so good coverage is essential. Inhibits respiration and photosynthesis causing death.

## Expected results   

Weeds turn brown and die within 3 to 5 days – more rapid under good growing conditions and when applied to seedling weeds. Poor results can be expected if weeds past 4-leaf stage, poor spray coverage or lower than recommended rate used. Injury to corn may occur if under stress.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 2 hours of application may reduce weed control. Grazing: Wheat, barley, oats and seedling alfalfa – do not use treated crops for grazing of livestock or green feed until 30 days after application. Do not cut treated crops for forage until 30 days after application. CAUTION: Do not graze other treated crops or cut for feed unless specified above; sufficient data are not available to support such use. Re-cropping: None.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours. See label for re-entry intervals for sweet corn.   

## Environmental precautions   

Bromoxynil is moderately to highly toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Avoid contamination of aquatic systems during application.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 368 mg/kg.   

## Storage

* Applications to emerged weeds require the addition of a non-ionic surfactant with 80% or greater active ingredient content at the lowest labelled rate for the surfactant regardless of crop stage.   

** Note: Certain weeds such as lamb’s-quarter and Canada fleabane are not controlled when applied post-emergent.   

## Registered tank mixes   

Dry beans: Eptam 1.72 - 2.12 L/acre at pre-emergent stage only. Requires incorporation.   

Field corn: 2,4-D, Accent, Aatrex, Dicamba and glyphosate in glyphosate tolerant corn only.   

## Application information   

Adding ingredients in the correct order is critical for optimum performance. Check labels of both products to be mixed for directions.   

## Application tips   

Do not apply by air. Water volume: Minimum 40 - 55 L/acre. Use the higher volume when there is a heavy crop canopy or weeds are at an advanced stage.   

## How it works   

Halosulfuron is a Group 2 herbicide that is absorbed by the foliage and roots, readily translocated throughout the plant and inhibits cell division. Symptoms on dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application depending on weed sensitivity, weed size, growing conditions and spray coverage.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Activity of foliar applications may be reduced if rainfall or irrigation occurs within 4 hours.  Pre-emergent surface applications will benefit from some rainfall, but excessive rainfall (greater than 1 inch or 2.5 cm) shortly after application may result in injury, especially when seeding is shallow. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Grazing: DO NOT graze or cut corn for livestock greenfeed within 30 days of the last application. Allow 30 days for sweet corn and 65 days for popcorn or grain corn from the last application to foliage and the harvesting of silage. Proso (crown) millet may be grazed immediately after treatment. DO NOT cut proso (crown) millet for hay within 37 days of application or feed straw within 50 days of application. Pre-harvest interval: DO NOT harvest dry beans within 30 days of post-emergent applications. DO NOT harvest proso (crown) millet within 50 days of application. There is no pre-harvest interval indicated for grain corn.   

Re-cropping interval: Delay seeding the following crops for the interval indicated:   

• dry common beans – no delay required • field corn – 1 month; • cereals (wheat barley and oats) – 2 months• potato, pea, forage legumes and soybean – 1 year • canola and sunflowers – 2 years• sugar beets – 36 months (3 years)   

## Environmental precautions   

TOXIC to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zones specified under DIRECTIONS FOR USE.   

## Toxicity:   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 1,287 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Store in a cool, secure place. Do not store for prolonged periods in direct sunlight.

How to apply: Apply with ground equipment. Do not apply by air. Water volume: Ground sprayers  – 45 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Maximum 40 psi (275 kPa) when using conventional flat fan nozzles. Crops that have been under stress before application may result in crop injury. Stress conditions within 3 days of application may also result in crop injury. Weeds under stress conditions at time of application may not be adequately controlled. Injury symptoms can be crop discolouration (yellowing, purpling or reddening) or stunting.   

## How it works   

Rapidly stops growth of susceptible weeds. However, typical symptoms (discolouration) of dying weeds  may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Up to 1 inch of rain beginning 1 hour or more after spraying will not reduce Pinnacle effectiveness.   

Grazing: Do not graze or cut for feed. Pre-harvest intervals: Minimum time (PHI) between application and harvest is 60 days. Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Re-cropping: Do not plant any crop other than wheat or barley, soybean, tomato or Group 2 tolerant canola for 30 days after application.

## How it works   

Pixxaro is a systemic herbicide that moves within the plant for control of exposed and underground plant tissues. The product controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms of weeds include epinasty (twisting of the stems) and swollen nodes. Warm, moist growing conditions promote active weed growth and enhance the activity of Pixxaro by allowing maximum foliar uptake and activity. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed and re-growth may occur.   

## Expected results   

Weeds start to twist between 2 to 20 days after spraying, dependant on weather conditions and nature of weeds. Following twisting and bending, plants will turn brown then die.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast within 1 hour of application. Grazing: Livestock may be grazed on treated crops 21 days following application. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application.   

Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Pixxaro can be seeded to fall rye and winter wheat 3 months after application. After a minimum of 10 months, can be seeded to spring wheat, spring barley, oats, alfalfa, canola, corn, faba bean, flax, field pea, mustard, commercial potato or fields can be summerfallowed. Lentil can be planted 22 months after application of Pixxaro. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

For tank mixes, consult the labels of the tank mix partners and observe the largest (most restrictive) buffer zone of the products involved in the tank mixture.   

## Toxicity

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground equipment or by air. Water volume: Ground – 20 - 45 L/acre. Dense foliage, heavy infestations and for quackgrass control – 45 - 80 L/acre. Air – 10 - 20 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

For optimum control of grassy weeds, when grasses are actively growing, there is good soil moisture and crop is small enough to permit thorough spray coverage. Grasses growing in less than ideal conditions are more difficult to control. Do not spray Poast Ultra if temperatures of 5°C or lower are forecasted within 3 days of application. Temperatures near freezing (below 5ºC) will prevent optimum herbicide performance, as weeds are not actively growing. Escapes or re-tillering may occur under prolonged stress conditions or low fertility. Do not apply on  grasses stressed longer than 20 days due to lack of moisture as unsatisfactory control can result.   

Quackgrass control: Apply when quackgrass is actively growing up to the 3-leaf stage (8 - 12 cm in height). Cultivation is necessary prior to spraying to stimulate even quackgrass growth and to obtain control. Where poor soil fertility (i.e., low nitrogen) exists, quackgrass control may not be satisfactory.   

## How it works   

Poast Ultra is a contact and a systemic herbicide. Absorbed primarily by foliage and translocated to the growing points. Inhibits formation of fatty acids in these tissues. Thorough coverage of the foliage is important for consistent grass control.   

## Expected results   

Susceptible grasses stop growing immediately, gradually turn yellow and then brown. The time required for complete control is normally 7 to 21 days (annual grasses). Control of quackgrass develops more slowly than control of annual grasses. Poast Ultra is translocated through the quackgrass plant to the rhizomes and kills actively growing rhizome buds, as well as above ground vegetation. Dormant rhizome buds will remain unaffected by the spray and regrowth can occur from these buds. The regrowth will not be significant until 6 to 8 weeks after treatment, depending on growing conditions, crop cultivation practices and crop competition.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour of application may reduce the weed control. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crop or cut for hay; sufficient data are not available to support such use. Forage legumes indicated in the label may be cut for hay provided pre-harvest intervals are followed. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 22 L/acre. Aerial application – 12 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Start with a clean and empty spray tank. Fill tank to half full with clean water. With agitator running, add the required amount of Predicade Broadleaf. Continue agitation until completely dissolved. Follow by adding Predicade Grass, Perimeter II, MCPA Ester. Maintain continuous agitation. Add the rest of water.   

## Application tips   

Higher spray volumes are needed with a dense crop canopy and/or large weeds. Predicade left in the tank for more than 24 hours might have reduced effectiveness. When crop is under stress, application may result in crop injury such as temporary crop colour lightening or a slight height reduction. Clean sprayer immediately after application and use ammonia. Under drought conditions, do not spray if time between seeding and spraying exceeds 35 days as drought hastens crop development. Do not spray 3 days prior to or following cold temperatures (3°C or lower).   

Note: Perimeter II Herbicide activity is influenced by weather conditions. Optimum activity requires active crop and weed growth. The temperature range for optimum activity is 12°C to 24°C. Reduced activity will occur when temperatures are below 8°C or above 27°C. Frost before application (3 days) or shortly after (3 days) may reduce weed control and crop tolerance. Weed control may be reduced during stress conditions, (e.g., drought, heat or cold stress, or if weeds have initiated flowering, or if heavy infestations exist.)   

## How it works   

Perimeter is absorbed through foliage and inhibits cell elongation. Causes stem elongation, leaf cupping or curling.   

## Expected results   

Growth stops immediately. Discolouration of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed species. Grassy plants develop chlorotic discolouration on the leaves, which sometimes turn red. Complete control may take 2 to 4 weeks. Poor results may be expected if there is improper mixing, timing, coverage or when weeds are under drought stress.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 2 hours of application may reduce weed control. Grazing: May not be grazed or fed to livestock within 7 days of application or cut for hay within 30 days after application. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest spring or durum wheat for grain or straw within 60 days of application. Re-cropping: barley, canola, flax, lentils, mustard, oats, alfalfa, field corn, dry bean, soybean, sunflower, pea, spring wheat (including durum) can be seeded 10 months after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

This product is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zones of 15 metres with ground application and 125 metres for fixed wing aerial, 100 metres for rotary wing aerial application. Do not allow into surface water, drains and groundwater.

## Application information:   

With: Apply with ground equipment only. Do not apply by air.   

Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Pre-seed weed burndown/summerfallow: PrePass must be applied to emerged, actively growing weeds. Warm, moist growing conditions promote active weed growth and enhance the activity of florasulam by allowing maximum foliar uptake and contact activity. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed and re-growth may occur. For best results, ensure thorough spray coverage of target weeds. Reduced control may also occur when applied to weeds heavily covered in dust.   

Fall stubble: Prepass can be applied until late October, but active weed growth must be present.

## How it works   

PrePass A and PrePass Flex are taken up by leaves and stops growth of susceptible weeds rapidly via inhibition  of the ALS enzyme. PrePass B is a non-selective systemic herbicide that moves through foliage into the roots, resulting in plant mortality.   

## Expected results   

Weeds susceptible to PrePass A or PrePass Flex will stop growing almost immediately. Newer leaves start to  yellow and wilt, followed by a loss of green colour. Symptoms will spread to the rest of the plant with some weeds showing purpling or reddening. Under good growing conditions, complete control may occur within 7 to 10 days  after application. Annual weeds susceptible to Prepass B or glyphosate applied with PrePass Flex will wilt and yellow within 2 to 4 days. Perennials will show similar symptoms within 5 to 10 days after application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Heavy rainfall immediately after application may wash the chemical off the foliage, reducing effectiveness. Do not apply if rainfall is imminent at time of application. Grazing: Do not graze treated areas within 7 days of application. Re-cropping: Pre-seed burn-down application – fields treated with PrePass herbicide tank mix can be seeded to barley, oats or wheat in the year of application. Summerfallow application: Fields treated with PrePass herbicide tank mix can be seeded to barley, canola, durum wheat, pea, wheat the following spring. Canola and  peas can be grown if fallow application occurred prior to August 1 in the fallow year. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Overspray or drift to sensitive habitats should be avoided. A buffer zone of 30 metres is required near sensitive habitats.   

## Toxicity   

Acute Oral LD50   

(rats) = > 5,000 mg/kg.

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground equipment or by air. Water volume: Ground – 20 - 40 L/acre. Air –12 - 20 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Will control only emerged weeds. Temperature range for optimum activity and control is 12°C to 24°C. Reduced activity will occur when temperatures are below 8°C or above 27°C. Frost before application (3 days) or shortly after (3 days) may reduce weed control and crop tolerance. Weed control may be reduced during stress conditions. Wet foliage at time of application may result in reduced weed control. Common chickweed control: Prestige will only control chickweed that is emerged at time of application. Chickweed plants which emerge after application will not be controlled. To improve the reduction in chickweed population at the end of season, delay the timing of application as late as possible to when the majority of chickweed plants have emerged.

## Herbicides

back to Table of Contents   

## How it works   

The components move within the plant to control exposed and underground plant tissue. The herbicide mimics naturally occurring plant hormones and controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms include twisting of stems and swollen nodes.   

## Expected results   

Weeds start to twist shortly after being sprayed. After twisting and bending, plants stop growing, turn brown and die. Difficult-to-control weeds such as Canada thistle and wild buckwheat stop growing, change colour to dark green and then turn yellow. Death may not occur for 14 to 21 days. Some weak Canada thistle regrowth may occur by the end of season   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if rain is expected within 4 hours. Grazing: Do not permit any grazing within 7 days after application. Do not harvest forage or cut hay within 7 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Re-cropping: Treated fields can be seeded the following year to barley, canola, corn, flax, forage grasses, mustard, oats, pea, rye, sugarbeet, wheat or summerfallowed. Very dry soil conditions following application can result in a risk of injury to field pea grown in the following year. If severe drought conditions are experienced during the months of June to August inclusive in the year of application (less than 140 mm rain between June 1 and August 31 or less than 175 mm rain in the whole year), delay seeding field pea an additional 12 months (22 months following application).  Contact your local Corteva Agriscience representative or retailer for more information before seeding field pea following drought conditions in the previous year. Do not seed crops other than those listed above for at least 1 year after treatment.

With: Ground Equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: Ground application – 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Mix florasulam herbicide, then add chosen glyphosate.   

## Application tips   

Pre-seed weed burndown/summerfallow: Priority and others must be applied to emerged, actively growing weeds. Warm, moist growing conditions promote active weed growth and enhance the activity of florasulam by allowing maximum foliar uptake and contact activity. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed, and regrowth may occur. For best results, ensure thorough spray coverage of target weeds. Reduced control may also occur when applied to weeds heavily covered in dust.   

## How it works   

Priority and others are taken by leaves and stops growth of susceptible weeds rapidly via inhibition of the ALS enzyme. Glyphosate is a non-selective systemic herbicide that moves through foliage into the roots, resulting in plant mortality.   

## Expected results   

Weeds: Weeds susceptible to florasulam will stop growing immediately. Newer leaves start to yellow and wilt, followed by a loss of green colour. Symptoms will spread to the rest of the plant with some weeds showing purpling or reddening. Under good growing conditions, complete control may occur within 7 to 10 days after application. Annual weeds susceptible to glyphosate will wilt and yellow within 2 to 4 days. Perennials will show similar symptoms within 5 to 10 days after application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Heavy rainfall immediately after application may reduce effectiveness. Do not apply if rainfall is imminent at time of application. Grazing: Do not graze treated areas within 7 days. Pre-harvest interval: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days of application. Re-cropping: Pre-seed burn down – fields treated with Priority/glyphosate tank mix can be seeded to barley, oats or wheat in the year of application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application information   

How to Apply: Ground or aerial application. Water Volume: Ground: 20 - 40 L/acre. Aerial: 12 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

Do not apply during periods of dead calm. Avoid application of this product when winds are gusty. Do not apply with spray droplets smaller than the American Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE S572.1) coarse classification. Boom height must be 60 cm or less above the crop or ground.   

## How it works   

Prominex is a mixture of a systemic auxin-type herbicides (Group 4). The product controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms include twisting, bending and yellowing; weeds will turn brown, resulting in plant mortality.   

## Expected results   

Weeds start to twist between 2 - 20 days after spraying, dependent on weather conditions and nature of weeds. Following twisting and bending, plants will turn brown and die.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall:  Applications are rain fast within 4 hours of application. Grazing: Livestock may be grazed on treated crops 7 days following application. Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Prominex herbicide can be seeded after a minimum of 10 months to spring wheat, barley, oats, canola, corn, soybeans, flax, field peas, mustard and timothy or fields can be summer-fallowed. Very dry soil conditions following application can result in a risk of injury to soybeans or field peas grown in rotation. If severe drought conditions are experienced during the months of June to August inclusive (less than 14 cm rainfall) in the year of application, delay seeding soybeans and field peas an additional

12 months (total 22 months following application). Pre-harvest Intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application. Do not cut the treated crop for hay or silage within 21 days after application.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions

## Registered tank mixes   

Glyphosate   

## Application information   

With: Ground equipment only. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Must be applied to emerged, actively growing weeds. Warm, moist growing conditions promote active weed growth and enhance the activity of Prospect herbicide applied alone or as a tank-mix with glyphosate herbicides. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed and re-growth may occur. For best results, ensure thorough spray coverage of target weeds.   

## How it works   

Prospect herbicide has 2 different herbicide modes of action: a systemic auxin-type herbicide (Group 4) that  moves within the plant for control of exposed and underground tissues; a PPO inhibitor herbicide (Group 14) that inhibits an enzyme within the plant.   

## Expected results   

Normal plant growth is disrupted. Symptoms of affected weeds include twisting of stems, swollen nodes and rapid leaf yellowing, followed by foliar desiccation and necrosis.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if rainfall is forecast at time of application. Grazing: Livestock can be grazed on treated canola fields 7 days after application. Pre-harvest interval: Canola can be harvested 60 days after application, or cut for fodder 21 days after application.   

Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Prospect herbicide can be seeded after a minimum of 10 months to spring wheat, spring barley, oats, canola, field corn, soybean, sunflower, flax, field pea, potato (except for field potato), mustard, alfalfa, dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris species including pinto, kidney and white types) and timothy or fields can be summerfallowed. Lentils can be planted 22 months after application of Prospect herbicide. Fall rye and winter wheat can be planted 3 months after application of Prospect herbicide.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## How it works   

Pulsar is a systemic, post-emergence herbicide for the selective control of the above mentioned weeds. Pulsar moves within the plant to control both exposed and underground plant tissues. The product controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms include epinasty (twisting of the stems) and swollen nodes.   

## Expected results   

Weeds: Can take up to 7 to 10 days depending on weather and growing conditions. Leaves curl, leaf edges turn brown, petioles twist, plant ceases growth and turns brown and dies. Crop: Improper or untimely application can result in abnormal bending at the nodes of grain stalks, difficulty in head emergence from sheath, curled awns, malformed kernels and sterile florets. Under certain conditions, straw shortening may occur but yield will not be affected.   

## Restrictions   

1 application per year is permitted.   

Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Pulsar can be seeded the following year to barley, canola, flax, forage grasses, lentils, mustard, oats, pea, rye or wheat or fields can be summerfallowed. Grazing: Do not graze cattle on treated crop, or harvest for silage until 7 days following the application of Pulsar. With tank mixes, graze or silage crop at least 12 weeks following treatment. Pre-harvest intervals: 60 days after application. Drift: Reduce drift and buffer zones by using either individual nozzle shields or a boom shield. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Rainfall: Pulsar alone can be used 1 hour before rainfall.

1  Do not apply fenoxaprop-p-ethyl alone in barley. Always tank mix with a registered broadleaf partner (except Puma Advance – however, expect some temporary crop injury on barley without a broadleaf tank mix partner). Note: Initial crop injury may be observed after application, but this is temporary and should not affect yield. This injury is most likely to occur when applications are made under stress conditions or when applications are made past the recommended leaf stage. Severe crop injury will occur as a result of spray overlap. 2 Initial crop injury may be observed after application, but this is temporary and should not affect yield.

## Application information   

How to apply: Apply with ground sprayers or by air. Water volume: Ground – 22 - 45 L/acre. Use higher water volume for dense canopies. Air: 13.5 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “c” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Application beyond the 6-leaf stage in spring wheat, durum wheat or barley may result in injury. Early application is important to maintain crop safety. Initial crop injury may occur in the form of crop shortening or discolouration and is more likely when fenoxaprop is applied alone and not tank mixed or is applied past the recommended leaf stage or under stressful growing conditions. Barley tends to be more susceptible to this injury than wheat. This condition is temporary and should not affect yield.   

Under stressed conditions and/or heavy crop canopy, early application will result in improved grassy weed control.  If another pesticide has already been applied, wait 7 days before applying fenoxaprop, or following application of fenoxaprop, a 4 day interval is required before applying another pesticide, except for those recommended on the label.   

## How it works   

Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl is a contact as well as systemic herbicide. It has no soil residual activity. Regions of high meristematic activity, such as root and shoot tips, are known to be affected.   

## Expected results   

Reduction of leaf growth and chlorosis blotching within 1 to 3 days after application. Initial development of leaf chlorosis within 5 to 8 days after application and complete death within 14 to 21 days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if rain is expected within 1 hour after spraying. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crops or cut for hay within 25 days of application. Do not graze treated perennial ryegrass or cut for straw within 65 days of application. Do not graze treated meadow bromegrass or use for hay within 25 days of application. Re-cropping: No restrictions the year after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Pre-harvest interval: Wheat/barley – 65 days.   

## Environmental precautions   

Fenoxzprop-p-ethyl is toxic to fish, daphnids, aquatic plants, terrestrial plants and some terrestrial invertebrates. Leave a 3 to 10 metres buffer zone around sensitive aquatic or terrestrial habitats.

## Registered tank mixes   

NewAgco supports the following mixes: Independence.   

## Application information   

With: Ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 - 160 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “a” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Do not spray if temperatures of 5ºC or lower are forecasted within 3 days of application. Temperatures near  freezing (below 5ºC) will prevent optimum herbicide performance, as weeds are not actively growing.   

## How it works   

Absorbed by foliage and roots. Disrupts plant metabolism causing growth to stop. Works best under good growing conditions.   

## Expected results   

Susceptible weeds stop growing within 24 to 48 hours. Yellow striping and purplish or reddish discolouration of the leaves may occur. Leaves begin to die in 3 to 10 days starting with the youngest and moving to the older leaves.  Death of the plant may occur in 1 to 3 weeks.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 6 hours of application may reduce activity. Grazing: Alfalfa – may be grazed or harvested for forage 14 days after application. Field pea – may be fed to livestock 30 days after application. Other crops – do not graze treated crops or cut for feed prior to crop maturity. Pre-harvest intervals: Field pea and chickling vetch – do not apply within 60 days of harvesting. Alfalfa – do not harvest within 14 days after application. Beans – do not harvest within 75 days after application. Soybeans – do not apply within 85 days of harvesting. Re-cropping:   

Black, Grey Wooded and Irrigated Brown soil zones – spring wheat, Group 2 tolerant canola, field pea, lentil and alfalfa may be planted the season following an imazethapyr application. Barley may be planted in the Black and Grey Wooded soil zones the season following application. Perform a field bioassay on other crops prior to planting them on a field-scale. In case of crop failure, replant only to Group 2 tolerant canola or field pea the year of application.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Imazethapyr is toxic to aquatic and non-target terrestrial plants. Do not apply within 15 metres of shelterbelts, water bodies, wetlands and woodland lots.   

## Toxicity   

Acute Oral LD50

## Registered Tank Mixes   

The following tank mixes are registered and supported by ADAMA Canada.   

Arrow 240 EC, Arrow All In, glyphosate, Leopard, Python B   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 40 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

For Quasar an adjuvant is required. Merge® at 0.5% v/v, Norac MSO at 0.5% v/v, Hasten® NT Ultra at  0.5% v/v or Agral® 90 at 0.25% v/v   

Cool weather conditions or drought may result in poor weed control. Use in hot, humid weather may result in temporary leaf yellowing, leaf flecking, bronzing or burning. The crop usually outgrows this condition within 10 days. When weeds are stressed, control can be reduced or delayed. Weeds escapes or regrowth may occur under prolonged stress conditions or low fertility.  Do not make applications to weeds stressed longer than 20 days due to lack of moisture, as unsatisfactory control can result.   

## How it works   

Upon application the active ingredients are readily absorbed through both leaf and root uptake and are translocated in the plant to inhibit amino acid production and cell division.   

## Expected results   

Plant growth is inhibited, and a few days after application, chlorosis and terminal bud injury become evident. Leaves and stems become yellow and purple, and root growth may be inhibited.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast in 3 hours. Grazing: Do not graze treated crop. Field peas may be fed to livestock 30 days after application. Re-cropping: There is the possibility of residual soil activity the year following application. The following crops may be safely grown in Black and Grey Wooded soil zones the year following DAVAI® 80 SL and PHANTOM® 240 SL applications: barley, spring wheat, lentil, field pea, Clearfield canola. Conduct a field bioassay (a test strip grown to maturity) the year before growing any other crop than those listed above. Re-entry interval:   

12 hours.

* Apply herbicide at bolting stage of development.   

The use of the highest rate structure improves the level and duration of weed control and is recommended when  weed populations are dense.   

## Application information   

Water: Ground equipment – 80 L/acre. Aerial – 20 L/acre.   

A non-ionic surfactant is required, such as Gateway adjuvant, at 0.2% v/v.   

## Mixing instructions   

Fill tank to ¾ full with water; use continuous agitation; add Reclaim A or Reclaim II A. Pre-slurrying with water  may be necessary where there is little or no agitation, or an injection system is being used or where herbicide is first added to a tank other than the spray tank. Add Reclaim B or Reclaim II B, then non-ionic surfactant and then an  anti-foaming agent (if required) then finish filling the tank.   

## Application Tips   

Application timing is critical for weed control. For optimum weed control, target weeds must be emerged and actively growing for proper translocation and systemic weed activity. Conditions such as drought or periods of slow growth may reduce the level of efficacy. Drift of even small amounts of Reclaim II onto sensitive plants or into  areas where sensitive crops may be grown can cause injury. Do not apply under conditions prone to drift  (i.e., high winds and temperature inversions).   

## How it Works   

Reclaim II is a herbicide that interferes with cell division causing leaf cupping, stem distortion and eventually the death of the plant. Reclaim II is absorbed through the leaves and roots of the plant.   

## Expected Results   

Perennial weeds show distorted stems and cupped leaves, which turn yellow and then brown. Usually, native grass increases in abundance as result of reduced competition. Poor results may be expected if weeds are not actively growing in late summer or as a result of environmental stress such as frost or drought.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: No effect. Effectiveness may be reduced if rain occurs within 4 hours of application. Grazing: Do not allow lactating dairy animals to graze treated areas within 7 days of application.  There is no restriction on livestock (except lactating dairy animals) grazing in treated areas. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter. Do not harvest forage or cut hay within 30 days of application.   

Re-cropping: If legumes are desired in a pasture, do not use Reclaim II. Do not plant to sensitive broadleaf crops for at least 3 years after application of Reclaim II. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental Precautions   

Runoff: Aminopyralid, 1 of the components in Reclaim, may move with water in very coarsely textured soils.   

## Toxicity   

Aminopyralid: Acute oral LD50   

= > 2,000 mg/kg; metsulfuron-methyl: Acute oral LD50   

=  > 5,000 mg/kg;  2,4-D ester: Acute oral LD50   

= 300 - 1,200 mg/kg.

Loveland Products will also support BroadSide with Axial Xtreme, Epic, Sierra 3.0 and Traxos. Apply mixes according to the most restrictive use limitations for either product.   

## Application information   

With: Ground and aerial equipment. Water volume: Ground – 22 L/acre (minimum). Aerial – 11 - 20 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “b” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Higher spray volumes are required for dense crop canopy and/or large weeds. Weeds should be less than 10 cm tall  or across at application. Effectiveness of Refine SG may be reduced if it remains in the tank for more than 24 hours.   

## How it works   

Absorbed through foliage. Refine SG inhibits cell elongation. MCPA ester is a systemic herbicide absorbed by leaf and stem and translocated to actively growing regions. It disrupts cell division causing abnormal growth.   

## Expected results   

Weeds: Growth stops immediately. Discolouration of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application depending on growing conditions and weed species. Poor results may be expected if there is improper mixing, timing, coverage or when weeds are under drought stress.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 2 hours of application may lessen degree of weed control with Refine M. Grazing: Barley, wheat and oats may be grazed or fed to livestock 7 days after application of Refine M. Do not graze the treated crop or cut for hay within 7 days of application of Refine SG. Re-cropping: All crops the following year.  Note: Do not exceed a total of 12 g/acre per crop year for the Refine SG part of Refine M.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Refine SG is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. For ground applications, maintain a  15-metre buffer zone between sprayed area and sensitive habitats.   

## Toxicity   

Thifensulfuron methyl: Oral LD50

## Application information   

With: Ground and aerial equipment. Water volume: Ground – 22 L/acre (minimum). Air – 11 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “b” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Higher spray volumes are required for dense crop canopy and/or large weeds. Weeds should be less than 10 cm tall  or across at application. Effectiveness of Refine SG may be reduced if it remains in the tank for more than 24 hours.   

## How it works   

Absorbed through foliage. Inhibits cell elongation.   

## Expected results:   

Weeds: Growth stops immediately. Discolouration of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application depending on growing conditions and weed species. Poor results may be expected if there is improper mixing, timing, coverage or when weeds are under drought stress.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour of application may lessen weed control. Grazing: Barley, wheat and oats may  be grazed or fed to livestock 7 days after application of Refine SG. Re-cropping: Canola, flax, lentils and alfalfa – 2 months after application; any crop the following year. There are no restrictions on next crop year. Note: Do not exceed a total of 12 g/acre per crop year for Refine SG. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Refine SG is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Follow label buffer zones between application areas and sensitive habitat.   

## Toxicity   

Thifensulfuron methyl: Oral LD50   

(rats) = > 5,000 mg/kg. Tribenuron methyl: Low oral toxicity.  Oral LD50

Rate: Reglone Ion – 0.61 L - 1.31 L/acre. All others – 0.51 - 1.09 L/acre. Check label for recommended adjuvant for all products other than Reglone Ion.   

## Crop   

## Staging   

## Beans (Adzuki, red  and white), soybean   

Apply when 80 - 90% natural leaf defoliation and when at least 80% of the pods have turned yellow   

## Canola   

This treatment does not mature canola. Reglone Ion is an effective desiccant aiding in the harvest of canola. Speed of pod and stem drydown will vary. However, pod and stem kill will take place 7 - 10 days after application. Apply when 90% or more of seed has turned brown; application of diquat prior to this stage can result in high levels of green seed in the sample. Reglone can cause shatter losses in canola. It should only be used on Argentine canola to assist in harvesting severely lodged crops   

## Chickpea   

Desi Type: Apply when the majority of plants are yellow and most pods are mature and seeds have turned from green to yellow or brown.Kabuli Type: Apply when the majority of plants and pods are ripe and dry with seeds turned from  green to white or tan and detached from the pods   

## Flax, solin   

Apply when 75% of bolls turn brown (normal swathing time)   

## Faba bean   

Apply when the majority of plants are ripe and dry. Pods will be fully filled and the bottom pods will  be tan or black in colour

## Crop   

## Staging   

## Legumes: Alfalfa, bird’s-foot trefoil, red and white clover (for seed production only)   

Prior to seed harvest. To prevent seed pods from shattering and subsequent loss of seed, the interval between spraying and harvest should not exceed 7 days Note: Do not use Reglone on forage legumes that have been treated with a residual herbicide in the past 12 months   

## Lentils   

Apply at the time swathing would normally commence. This is when the lower-most pods are yellow-brown and seeds rattle   

## Mustard (condiment type)   

Spray when the crop is at the 75% seed turn brown stage   

## Pea (field and dry)   

Apply when bottom pods of the majority of the plants are ripe and dry with the seeds detached from the pods. Seeds in less mature pods will split when squeezed   

Potato – vine kill (Reglone 240 and Diquash only)   

Reglone Ion contains a built in surfactant and should not be used on pototo   

## Sunflower   

When the seeds reach maturity (20 - 50% moisture in the seed and hull). Combine 15 - 20 days after spraying

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: See above table. Reglone Ion has a built-in surfactant.   

## Application tips   

Application should be made immediately ahead of sunny weather as sunshine activates the herbicide. Ground sprayer application will facilitate the use of higher water volumes and provide more complete coverage. Aerial application may be used with aircraft fitted to apply uniform spray coverage. Muddy water will reduce effectiveness. Applications made on cloudy days or just prior to or during periods of darkness will increase effectiveness. Immature weeds may require higher application rates to increase effectiveness.   

## How it works   

Diquat is a contact type herbicide; therefore, thorough spray coverage with high water volumes is essential. Absorbed by all leaf and stem surfaces, non-systemic and interferes with photosynthesis.

## Expected results   

Weeds: Fast and virtually complete top kill of annual weeds. Yellowing starts within a few hours of application. Desiccation of the plant will continue rapidly till death. Crops: Leaf kill will occur within a few days of application. Stem dry-down will take longer depending on the crop; however, harvesting should normally commence within 7 to 14 days. Crop losses can occur due to pod drop and pod shatter from handling and if unfavourable weather conditions occur. Warning: During adverse weather (heavy rain, hail or strong winds), the resultant damage to crops may be enhanced.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: No effect once the spray solution has dried. Grazing: Crop waste remaining after harvest (e.g., pea and lentil vines, alfalfa stems, etc.) may be used as a feed supplement for livestock. Pre-harvest intervals: For most crops, harvest can normally commence within 4 to 10 days after desiccation. Alfalfa, bird’s-foot trefoil, red clover, white clover – to prevent pod shattering and loss of seed, the interval between spraying and harvest should not exceed 7 days. Canola/mustard – Combine no later than 14 days after application. Diquat should only be used on Argentine varieties to facilitate a harvest of lodged crops.  Losses can occur due to pod drop and pod shatter from handling or if unfavourable weather conditions occur as described under product information. Flax and pea – harvest when seed tests “dry.” Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Reduce chance of drift and contamination of any aquatic or sensitive terrestrial habitat by using a 15-metre buffer around the edges of water bodies.

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground equipment or by air. Water volume: Ground application – 80 L/acre minimum.  Aerial application requires 20 L/acre minimum water volume.   

## Application tips   

Application timing is critical for weed control. For optimum weed control, target weeds must be emerged and actively growing for proper translocation and systemic weed activity. Conditions such as drought or periods of slow growth may reduce the level of efficacy.   

## How it works   

Restore II is a herbicide that interferes with cell division causing leaf cupping, stem distortion and eventually death of the plant. Restore II is absorbed through the leaves and roots of the plant.   

## Expected results   

Perennial weeds show distorted stems and cupped leaves, which turn yellow and then brown. Usually, native grass increases in abundance as result of reduced competition. Poor results may be expected if weeds are not actively growing in late summer or as a result of environmental stress such as frost or drought.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: If rainfall occurs within 4 hours of application, effectiveness may be reduced. Grazing: Do not allow lactating dairy animals to graze treated areas within 7 days of application. There is no restriction on livestock (except lactating dairy animals) grazing in treated areas. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest forages or cut hay within 30 days of application.   

Re-cropping: If legumes are essential in a pasture, do not use Restore II. Do not break up treated pasture and plant to sensitive broadleaf crops for at least 3 years after application of Restore II. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Restore II is toxic to small wild mammals, birds, aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. When applying by ground sprayer, leave a 10-metre buffer zone between application area and sensitive terrestrial and aquatic habitats. When apply by air, leave a 70 - 175 metre buffer zone. Restore II is mobile in water and subject to leaching and ground movement.

For best top growth control, apply before bud stage when thistles are no larger than 15 cm in height. A single application will effectively inhibit the ability of emerged thistles to compete with the crop. 3 If the product is used without a wild oat herbicide, add a non-ionic surfactant such as Ag-Surf at a rate of 0.2% v/v (2 L/1000 L of spray solution).

## Registered tank mixes   

None registered. Agricity supports the mixing of glyphosate with Revenge A. Apply mixes according to the most restrictive use limitations for either product.   

## Application information   

How to Apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “b” on page 15.   

## Application Tips   

Best activity occurs when applied between 10 - 25°C. Avoid application when crop is under stress from adverse environmental conditions such as drought, excessive rainfall or severe heat or cold. Do not spray if risk of frost or severe drop in night temperature is forecast. Do not apply in conditions conducive to thermal inversions or product may drift into sensitive crops.   

## How it Works   

Carfentrazone is rapidly absorbed by foliage. Inhibits the PPO enzyme. Dicamba is absorbed through roots and leaves and translocated in the phloem and xylem, disrupting the metabolism.   

## Expected Results   

Carfentrazone is absorbed rapidly with death of susceptible plants within 3 - 4 days. Dicamba will cause twisting and bending of leaves and stem with death of susceptible plants taking up to 14 days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast in 1 hour. Grazing: Fields may be grazed 7 days after application.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre minimum.   

## How it works   

Carfentrazone acts primarily as a contact herbicide; as such, good coverage is essential for activity. Carfentrazone inhibits the PPO enzyme involved in chlorophyll and heme synthesis. Bromoxynil is a limited systemic herbicide  that inhibits respiration and photosynthesis.   

## Expected results   

Initial symptoms are browning, and plant death occurs in a few days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 2 hours after application may reduce weed control. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crop or cut for feed. Pre-harvest intervals: 3 days. Re-cropping: No rotational restrictions 12 months after application.   

Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Bromoxynil is moderately to highly toxic to aquatic organisms.   

## Toxicity   

Bromoxynil: Oral LD50   

(rats) = 368 mg/kg. Carfentrazone-ethyl: Oral LD50

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 40 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

Due to rapid absorption by the leaves, translocation of the contact herbicide active is very limited. It is essential to get good plant coverage for optimum performance. Extremes in environmental conditions may affect activity. Revenge E can be applied only one time per growing season.   

## How it works   

Revenge E has systemic and contact activity. Revenge inhibits the PPO enzyme involved in chlorophyll and heme synthesis. This action results in leaky cell membranes and rapid browning and death. MP Extra is absorbed by foliage and roots, and inhibits cell elongation.   

## Expected results   

Initial contact symptoms are browning leading to necrosis and may occur within hours to a few days. Symptoms of systemic activity (discolouration) may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility.

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour of application may reduce weed control. Grazing: No grazing restrictions   

Re-cropping: 2 months after application, canola, flax, lentil or alfalfa may be seeded. No rotational restrictions 12 months after application. Pre-harvest intervals: No pre-harvest interval for registered crops.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not contaminate irrigation water. Tribenuron is toxic to aquatic organisms. Recommended buffer zone of 5 metres from any sensitive habitat without the use of any drift control aids.   

## Toxicity

Apply only after weeds are visible and in an active stage of growth which is normally sometime in late May through June as growth is dependent on water temperatures   

For areas less than 1.5 m (5 feet) deep: 7.4 L/acreFor areas more than 1.5 m (5 feet) deep: 10 - 11.8 L/acreCalculating area to be treated: length (m) x width (m) ÷ 10,000 m2 x 2.47 = acres   

## Application information   

How to apply: For floating weeds, use surface application: Dilute 1 part Reward with at least 4 parts clean water and spray over water surface. Apply from the banks of small bodies of water.   

For submerged weeds, inject below the water surface: A suction type of boat bailer is mounted on the cavitation plate of an outboard motor and the end of the inlet tube inserted into a solution containing 1 part Reward diluted with at least 10 parts of clean water (a backpack sprayer may also be used). Make lines of travel at regular intervals through the water (3 metres or less apart) over the area to be treated until the whole area has received a uniform application.   

## Application tips   

Do not apply to muddy water and do not agitate water excessively during 1 or 2 days after treatment as the effectiveness of the chemical will be reduced. Use clean water for diluting the chemical. Do not use wetting agents  or surfactants for water treatment. Repeat treatment may be necessary if weed growth reappears. Avoid application  or drift onto crops or other desirable growth.   

## How it works   

Reward is a contact herbicide. Thorough coverage on the weeds is essential to ensure satisfactory control. Interferes with photosynthesis.

## Expected results   

Control of susceptible weeds generally occurs within 1 to 2 weeks.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: None. Grazing: Do not use treated water for at least 24 hours after treatment for swimming and animal consumption. Fish protection: To protect the fish in small lakes and ponds with a dense weed growth, treat not more than 1/4 to 1/3 of the area at 1 time, otherwise the dying weeds over a large area will cause a serious loss of oxygen which may injure or kill the fish. Human consumption and irrigation: Do not use for at least 5 days after treatment.

Best results are obtained from applications made to seedling weeds.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “b” on page 15. Note, a surfactant is not required for mixes.   

## How it works   

Rexade should be applied to actively growing weeds. Warm, moist growing conditions promote active weed growth and enhance the activity of Rexade by allowing for maximum foliar uptake and movement of the herbicide into the targeted weeds. Rexade is a mixture of auxin herbicides (Group 4) and an ALS enzyme inhibitor herbicide (Group 2). The product controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns and/or by inhibiting the production of the enzymes essential for the production of certain amino acids for plant growth.   

## Expected results   

Weeds start to twist between 2 to 20 days after spraying, depending on weather conditions, rate of growth, moisture and the weeds being targeted by this herbicide application. Symptoms include twisting, bending and yellowing; weeds will turn brown, resulting in plant mortality.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application if rainfall is forecast within 1 hour. Grazing: Livestock may be grazed on treated crops 7 days following application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop for 60 day after application. Re-cropping: Fields can be seeded 11 months following an application of Rexade A with the following crops: spring barley, spring wheat, oats, canola, flax, brown and yellow mustard, canola quality   

Brassica juncea, field pea, potato (excluding seed potato) and soybean, or fields can be summerfallowed. Sunflowers can be planted 10 months and lentils 22 months after application of Rexade.   

## Environmental precautions   

A 1-metre buffer zone is required between the treated area and terrestrial and water habits. Do not allow spray drift  to come in contact with sensitive broadleaf crops. Spray when the wind velocity is 15 km/hr or less.

## Registered tank mixes   

Rezuvant is not intended to be used without the addition of MCPA Ester 600. Add at the rate of 187 - 234 mL/acre  (53 - 40 acres per 10 L jug). MCPA Ester 600 is not included in the Rezuvant package and must be purchased separately.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground or aerial application. Use coarse nozzles for application to reduce drift risk.   

Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre for ground application, minimum 12 L/acre by air.   

## Application tips   

For optimum control, apply to actively growing weeds. Weed control following application of Rezuvant B herbicide, in combination with Rezuvant A herbicide, can be reduced or delayed under stress conditions such as drought, heat, insufficient fertility, flooding, or prolonged cool temperatures. If foliage is wet at the time of application, control may be decreased.   

302   

## Herbicides   

Purchase the printed edition of Crop Protection 2023 for only $15. Buy it on-line here.   

back to Table of Contents   

Under conditions of low crop and high weed density, control may be reduced. Optimum weed control will be obtained if application is delayed until the stress conditions have ended and the weeds have resumed growth.   

## How it works   

Rezuvant A herbicide provides a Group 4 mode of action broad leaf herbicide. The group 4 mode of action disrupts normal plant growth regulation resulting in the death of susceptible plants. Rezuvant B herbicide contains a Group 1 mode of action which is absorbed by the leaves and rapidly translocated to the growing points of the leaves and stems.   

## Expected results   

Broadleaf weeds start to twist between 2 to 20 days after spraying, depending on weather and growing conditions. Symptoms include twisting, bending and yellowing; weeds will turn brown, resulting in plant mortality. Actively growing susceptible grasses stop growing within 48 hours of treatment. Depending on grass species, growing conditions and crop competition, leaves and growing points turn yellow within 1 to 3 weeks after application, followed by browning and control 3 to 5 weeks after application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast within 1 hour after application. Grazing: Do not graze for 7 days or silage/hay for 30 days following application. Pre-harvest interval: Do not harvest the treated crop for grain within 60 days of application.   

Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Rezuvant can be seeded after a minimum of 10 months to spring wheat, spring barley, oat, canola, corn, soybean, sunflower, faba bean, flax, field pea, potato (except seed potato), mustard, alfalfa, dry beans (P. vulgaris species including pinto, kidney and white types) and timothy. Lentils can  be planted 22 months after application of Rezuvant. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not contaminate any body of water, including irrigation water. Use a buffer zone of 2 metres between terrestrial  habitat and a minimum of 1 metre between aquatic habitats.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = >5,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage

back to Table of Contents   

## Registered tank mixes   

Herbicides: glyphosate (Roundup brands) – top up of total glyphosate to a maximum of 720 g ae/acre. DO NOT add acidifying buffering agents, acidic pH adjusting agents or adjuvants other than agriculturally approved NIS to the spray solution. DO NOT add ammonium sulfate (AMS), AMS-containing adjuvants, water conditioners or sprayable fluid fertilizers. Check labels of products to be mixed for directions.   

## Application information   

With: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40L/acre minimum.   

Nozzles and pressure: Use only nozzles that produce extremely coarse or ultra-coarse droplet sizes. Refer to label for a full description of application requirements. DO NOT allow herbicide solution to mist, drip, drift or splash onto desirable vegetation because severe injury or destruction to desirable broadleaf plants could result. Apply when air temperature is between 10 and 25°C. DO NOT spray when the temperature is expected to exceed 30°C.  When applying Roundup Xtend adjacent to sensitive crops, apply as a pre-plant, pre-emergent or early post-emergent treatment to avoid potential drift onto the sensitive crops. Apply to small actively growing weeds less than 10 cm (4 inches) in height or width.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Within 4 hours of application may reduce control. Grazing: DO NOT permit lactating dairy animals to graze fields within 7 days after application. DO NOT harvest forage or cut hay within 30 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter.   

Re-cropping: A plant-back interval of 120 days is required for those crops not on the label of Roundup Xtend/Roundup Xtend 2 with VaporGrip Technology. Do not count days when the ground is frozen. Moisture is essential for the degradation of this herbicide in soil. If dry weather persists after application, crop injury may occur the following spring. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Buffer zones of 15 metres are required between the area of application and aquatic and terrestrial sensitive areas. Distance is measured from the downwind edge of the boom to sensitive areas. Runoff: Avoid runoff risk under conditions of heavy rainfall, moderate to steep slope, bare soil, poorly draining soil. Leaching: This product will move with water. Avoid using in areas where soils are permeable and/or the depth to the water table is shallow.

## Application information   

How to Apply: Apply with ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water Volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing Instructions   

Samurai Master: Use mixing instructions “b” on page 15. Davai A Plus: Add the products in the following order: Arrow All In, Davai 80 SL, tank mix partner, adjuvant.   

## Application tips   

If agitation is stopped for more than 5 minutes, re-suspend spray solution by full agitation prior to commencing spraying again. Cool weather conditions or drought will delay herbicidal activity and if prolonged, may result in poor weed control. Use of herbicide in hot, humid weather may result in temporary leaf yellowing, leaf flecking, bronzing or burning. The crop usually outgrows this condition within 10 days. Do not make applications to weeds stressed longer than 20 days due to lack of moisture, as unsatisfactory control can result.   

## How it works   

Imazamox is absorbed by foliage and roots. Disrupts plant metabolism causing growth to stop. Works best under good growing conditions. Clethodim is a systemic herbicide that is translocated from the treated foliage to the growing points of leaves, shoots and roots.   

## Expected results   

Leaf foliage will first change from green to yellowing, then purplish and finally a brown colour. The time required for complete control is 7 to 21 days following treatment, depending on growing conditions and crop competition.

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 3 hours of application may reduce control. Grazing: Do not graze treated crop or cut for feed within 60 days of application. Do not harvest treated crops within 75 days of application.   

Pre-harvest intervals: Field pea – 60 days. Dry bean – 75 days. Soybean – 85 days. Imidazoline-tolerant lentil – 60 days. Re-cropping: The following crops may be grown safely the year following an application: Field pea, canola, spring wheat, durum wheat, spring barley, tame oats, flax, Clearfield® sunflower. For Davai A Plus the following crops can also be replanted: canary seed, chickpea, corn, soybean. Conduct a field bioassay (a test strip grown to maturity) the year before growing any crop other than those listed above. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

t Initial injury to non-Clearfield canola may be observed.   

Environmental precautions: Highly toxic to aquatic plants and non-target terrestrial plants, and moderately to highly toxic to aquatic organisms. Leave at least an 11-metre buffer strip between the point of application and sensitive aquatic and terrestrial habitats.

Note: Dry common bean varieties may vary in their tolerance to clethodim (Arrow/Centuron/Select/Shadow/Patron). Since not all dry common bean varieties have been tested for tolerance to clethodim, first use of clethodim should be limited to a small area of each variety to confirm tolerance prior to adoption as a general field practice. Additionally, consult your seed supplier for information on the tolerance of specific varieties of dry common beans to clethodim.

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground equipment. Some crops are registered for use by aerial applications. Refer to label for list of crops registered for aerial applications. Water volume: Ground – 22 - 91 L/acre. Aerial application –  11 L/acre minimum.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “c” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

The use of 80° stainless steel flat fan nozzles tilted 45° forward is recommended for optimum spray coverage.  Use high water volumes on dense crop canopies for better penetration to weeds.   

## How it works   

Clethodim is a systemic herbicide that is translocated from the treated foliage to the growing points of leaves, shoots and roots.   

## Expected results   

Weeds: Leaf foliage will first change from green to yellowish, then purplish and finally a brown colour. The time required for complete control is 7 to 21 days following treatment, depending on growing conditions and crop competition.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour of application may reduce the effectiveness of the spray. Grazing: Do not cut treated crops for feed or graze until 60 days after application to annual crops and 30 days after application to seedling alfalfa.   

Pre-harvest intervals: Canola, coriander, common dry bean, caraway, chickpea (desi, Kabuli), faba bean, flax (including Solin), lentil, potato and mustard (brown, yellow oriental): 60 days. Alfalfa, carrot, fenugreek, radish, red garden beet and parsnip – 30 days. Dill – 40 days Sunflower – 72 days. Field pea, soybean – 75 days.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Re-cropping: 30 day plant back interval required for crops not listed on the label.   

## Environmental precautions   

Clethodim is moderately to highly toxic to aquatic organisms. Avoid contamination of aquatic systems  during application.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(male rats) = 2,920 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Does not require heated storage.

## Application information   

With: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: Ground – post-emergence barley, wheat –  30 - 40 L/acre. Chickpea, lentil, pea – 70 L/acre. Pre-plant incorporated (field pea, lentil, faba bean, soybean) –  40 L/acre. Potato – 40 - 120 L. Note: In potato, higher rates of water increase crop tolerance.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “a” on page 15.   

## Incorporation   

Be aware of soil organic matter levels when applying metribuzin either alone or with a soil incorporated mix with other herbicides. Special conditions may apply.   

With irrigation: Metribuzin + Eptam – Potatoes – pre-emergence in sprinkler irrigation. Apply specified dosage in  8 to 19 mm of water per hectare (3.8 mm/acre) on a continuous injection in centre pivot systems, or in the last  15 to 30 minutes of set in permanent solid set sprinkler system of self-propelled wheel move systems. On sandy soil, apply in 8 to 12 mm of water and use the lower rate of metribuzin and Eptam. Apply pre-emergence to crop and weeds. Use the higher rate for control of grassy weeds or when broadleaf weeds are dense.   

## Application tips   

Allow 4 to 5 days between application of metribuzin and post-emergent wild oats herbicides. Allow 4 to 5 days after frost for crop to recover before applying metribuzin. Weed control may be reduced if applied later than the 5-leaf stage of crop. Crop may be sprayed when wet with dew. When incorporated, crop must be planted at least 5 cm below soil surface. Uneven application or improper incorporation of can result in erratic weed control or crop injury depending on rate used.   

Stress conditions such as seedling disease, cold weather, deep planting, excessive moisture, high salt concentration, or drought may weaken seedlings and increase the possibility of crop damage from the herbicides. Temporary lightening in colour may occur on the margin of leaves or cotyledons and a slight delay in crop development may be observed. This is quickly outgrown and usually has no lasting effect.   

## How it works   

A systemic herbicide absorbed by leaves and roots and translocated to new growth. Inhibits photosynthesis and the weed turns brown and dies.

## Expected results   

Broadleaf weeds: Initial yellowing 5 to 7 days after application; weeds turn brown and die within 14 to 16 days. Active in soil for a short period and can control new shallow-rooted germinants, like chickweed.   

Crops: In extremely hot weather or when frost occurs within 1 to 2 days of application, crop will show some yellowing and slight reduction in height. Discolouration disappears in 7 to 10 days. On some barley varieties, temporary lightening in colour and reduction in height may occur. Lentils and peas provide little competition against weed growth due to their low growth habit. Under heavy weed infestations or lush growth, control may be poor.   

Field pea and lentil: Stressful conditions increase the possibility of damage. Temporary lightening on the margins of cotyledons and a slight delay in development may occur. Ensure 70 L/acre Water volume is used to reduce crop injury.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 6 hours after application may reduce weed control. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Grazing: Spring wheat and barley – 30 days, peas (field and processing), chickpea, lentil – 70 days. Other crops – not specified. Pre-harvest intervals: Spring wheat, barley, potatoes – 60 days. Processing peas, chickpea – 40 days. Field pea, lentil – 70 days. Other crops – not specified. Re-cropping: 24 months are required for crops other than potatoes if 910 mL/acre (610 g/acre) is applied. Canola, celery, cole crops, cucurbits, lettuce, onion, pepper, spinach, sugar beet, table beet and turnip may be injured if planted in soil treated with metribuzin during the year of application and the following crop year. Fall seeded or cover crops such as wheat, oats, and rye may be injured when seeded in the same season as the application of metribuzin.   

## Environmental precautions   

Avoid contamination of water bodies through the use of buffer zones: 5 metres for aquatic habitats and 10 metres between sensitive terrestrial habitats.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground or aerial equipment. Water volume: Ground 22 L/acre minimum. Aerial: 10 - 20 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

1. Always start with a clean and empty sprayer tank.   

2. Fill the tank to 1/2 full with clean water.   

3. With the agitator running, add the required amount of Sentrallas® herbicide. Continue agitation until Sentrallas®   

herbicide is completely dispersed.   

4. If tank mixing Sentrallas® herbicide with another herbicide, follow this mixing order: Dry flowables and soluble granules first, followed by solutions, then oil dispersions (OD) or emulsifiable concentrates (EC). Maintain continuous agitation. Add the rest of the water.   

5. Add the appropriate adjuvant, if required. If an antifoam agent is required, add last.   

## Application tips   

Sentrallas® herbicide activity is influenced by weather conditions. The temperature range for optimum activity is 12°C - 24°C. Reduced activity will occur when temperatures are below 8°C or above 27°C. Frost before application (3 days) or shortly after (3 days) may reduce weed control and crop tolerance. Weed control may be reduced during stress conditions: e.g., drought, heat or cold stress, or if weeds have initiated flowering or if heavy infestations exist. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed and regrowth may occur.   

## How it works   

Absorbed through foliage. Inhibits cell elongation.Causes stem elongation, leaf cupping or curling.

## Expected results   

Growth stops immediately. Discolouration of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 - 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed species.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 2 hours of application may reduce weed control. Grazing: Do not graze or feed the treated crop to livestock within 7 days of application. Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Sentrallas® herbicide can be seeded the following year to alfalfa, barley, canola, corn, dry beans, flax, forage grasses, lentils, mustard, oats, peas, potatoes, rye, soybeans, sugar beets, sunflowers or wheat. Pre-harvest Intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days of application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Do not apply more than 202 mL/ acre of Sentrallas®   

herbicide per year.

## Application tips   

Applications made during warm, moist conditions (21°C or more) and adequate soil moisture both before and  after application maximizes performance. Under cool or dry conditions, control of some weeds may by severely reduced. Overall weed control may be improved with the addition of a nitrogen source such as UAN or AMS.  Target applications to corn less than 30 cm tall for improved coverage and best overall performance. Do not apply atrazine if corn is greater than 30 cm.   

## How it works   

Tolpyralate is absorbed through foliage and is translocated to the meristematic regions. It inhibits the HPPD enzyme causing bleaching of leaves   

## Expected results   

Rapid bleaching of leaves within days, and plant death within 7 to 14 days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall with 1 hour may reduce activity. Grazing: Do not graze or feed treated corn forage or silage within 21 days of application. Re-cropping: All types of corn can be planted immediately after application of Shieldex. Winter wheat, rye (annual and fall) can be planted 3 months after application. Alfalfa, barley, dry bean, canola, oats, field pea, potato, sorghum, soybean, sunflower and spring wheat can be planted 9 months after application. Sugar beet can be planted 18 months after application, and the year after application, all other rotational crops can be planted.   

Re-entry interval: Corn detasseling: 2 days. All other activities 12 hours. Pre-harvest intervals: Field corn – 45 days. Sweet corn – 35 days.   

## Environmental precautions   

Sheildex is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Contamination of aquatic areas as a result of runoff may be reduced by including a vegetative strip between the treated area and the edge of the water body.   

## Toxicity

## Application information   

With: Ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 22 L/acre. Surfactant included in Signal  FSU package.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “b” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Higher spray volumes are required for dense crop canopy and/or large weeds. Weeds should be less than 10 cm tall or across at application. Effectiveness of Signal FSU may be reduced if it remains in the tank for more than 24 hours. Do not use flood type nozzles, controlled droplet application equipment, spray foils or hollow cone nozzles. Do not apply to crop stressed by conditions such as frost, low fertility, drought, flooding, disease or insect damage as crop injury may result.   

## How it works   

Signal FSU is absorbed by the foliage and rapidly translocated to the growing points. Inhibits cell elongation in broadleaf weeds. Thorough coverage of the plants is essential for consistent control.   

## Expected results   

Broadleaf weed growth stops immediately. Discolouration of dying weeds may be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed species. Grassy weeds: depending on the species, growing conditions and crop competition, leaves and growing points turn yellow within 1 to 3 weeks after application. Poor results may be expected if there is improper mixing, timing or coverage, or when weeds are under drought stress.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour of application may lessen degree of weed control with Signal FSU. Grazing: Wheat may be grazed 7 days after the application of Signal FSU. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest forage or cut hay within 60 days after application. Re-cropping: Barley, canola, flax, forage grasses, lentil, mustard, oats, pea, rye or wheat or fields can be summerfallowed the year after treatment. Do not exceed a total of 8 g/acre of Boost per crop year.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Clodinafop-propargyl is highly toxic to fish. Do not apply clodinafop-propargyl on freshwater habitats. Use a  15-metre buffer between the treated area and sensitive aquatic environments.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application.   

Water volume: Ground – 20 - 40 L/acre. Aerial – 12 - 20 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “a” on page 15. Dry formulated products are added to the spray tank first.   

## Application tips   

Only weeds emerged at time of application are controlled. For optimum results, apply Simplicity to actively growing seedling weeds. Weed control may be reduced if Simplicity is applied under stress conditions. Do not apply to crops that are stressed as crop injury may result. Under conditions of low crop competition and high weed density or wet foliage at time of application, control may be reduced.   

## How it works   

Simplicity inhibits the production of the ALS enzyme in plants. This enzyme is essential for the production of  certain amino acids, which are essential for plant growth.   

## Expected results   

Simplicity rapidly stops the growth of susceptible weeds. However, typical symptoms (discolouration) of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks following application, depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility. Degree of control and duration of symptoms depend on weed sensitivity, weed size, crop competition, growing conditions following treatment and spray coverage.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rain within 2 hours of application may reduce control. Grazing: Livestock may be grazed on treated crops 7 days following application. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 50 days after application.   

Re-cropping: 11 months following an application of Simplicity, the following crops can be seeded: alfalfa, barley, brown mustard, canola, corn, dry bean (of the species Phaseolus vulgaris), flax, canola quality Brassica juncea, lentil, oats, field pea, potato, chickpea, spring wheat, soybean, sunflower and yellow mustard or summerfallowed.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Simplicity is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Avoid contaminaton of these sensitive  areas by using the recommended buffer of 1 metre from water bodies and 2 metres from sensitive terrestrial areas.

1 Includes group 9,4 and 2 resistant biotypes. 2 Season-long top growth control.3 When tank mixed with glyphosate will provide rapid burndown control of these weeds in addition to those weed listed under Smoulder applied alone.4 Provides control of secondary flushes of volunteer canola (including Roundup Ready and LibertyLink) in addition to burndown control of volunteer canola (all types).   

## Registered tank mixes   

Smoulder should be tank mixed with glyphosate at 0.5 - 1 L/acre of 360 g/L equivalent.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Add products to the spray tank in the following order: Smoulder, Glyphosate, Merge. When adding Smoulder continue agitation until completely dissolved and product is fully dispersed.   

## Application tips   

Do not use on soils that have large gravelly or sandy areas, eroded knolls or calcium deposits.   

## How it works   

Smoulder is rapidly absorbed by foliar and root uptake. Under active growing conditions susceptible emerged weeds develop injury symptoms within hours of application; plant death occurs within 3 - 5 days Susceptible emerging weed seedlings will usually die as they reach the soil surface shortly after emergence.   

## Expected results   

Susceptible weeds will develop injury symptoms shortly after application, then death of the weeds will be 3 - 5 days after application.

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Follow the glyphosate manufacturers recommendation for rain fastness. Grazing: Wheat and barley may be used as feed (hay or silage) or grazed 30 or more days after application. Re-cropping: Fields treated with Smoulder may be seeded to wheat (durum, spring and winter) or barley a minimum of 24 hours after application. Canola (all types), field corn, flax, Clearfield lentils, peas, faba beans and soybeans may be seeded 11 months after application. Oats may be seeded anytime the following season. Research studies have shown that flax may be safely planted 11 months following a Smoulder application in all regions of Western Canada except the brown soil zone. In the brown soil zone, observe a minimum 22 month recropping interval. Fields treated in the fall with post-harvest application of Smoulder may be seeded in the spring to wheat (spring or durum), barley or oats. Pre-harvest intervals: 60 days when used as a pre-seed application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Avoid spraying in situations where drift may occur. Toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. To reduce runoff from treated area into aquatic habitats avoid application to areas with a moderate to sleep slope, compacted soil or clay. Do not apply during periods of dead calm or gusty winds.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre minimum.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “a” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Water soluble bags will dissolve better when kept intact; do not split bags. If agitation is stopped for more than  5 minutes, re-suspend spray solution by full agitation prior to commencing spraying again. Do not spray if temperatures of 5ºC or lower are forecasted within 3 days of application. Temperatures near freezing (below 5ºC) will prevent optimum herbicide performance, as weeds are not actively growing. Initial transient crop yellowing may be observed after application, but this is outgrown and should not affect yield.   

## How it works   

Absorbed by foliage and roots. Disrupts plant metabolism causing growth to stop. Works best under good  growing conditions.   

## Expected results   

Susceptible weeds stop growing within 24 to 48 hours. Yellow striping and purplish or reddish discolouration of the leaves may occur. Leaves begin to die in 3 to 10 days starting with the youngest and moving to the older leaves. Death of the plant may occur in 1 to 3 weeks.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 3 hours of application may reduce control. Grazing: Do not graze treated crop or cut for feed within 20 days of application. Do not graze treated sunflower plants or cut for straw; sufficient data are not available to support such use. Peas treated with Davai can be fed to livestock 30 days after application.   

Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days of application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Re-cropping: The following crops may be grown safely the year following an application: field pea, field corn, canary seed*, Group 2 tolerant canola, non-Group 2 tolerant canola*,lentils, spring wheat, durum wheat*, spring barley, sunflower, tame oats*, flax*, chickpea. The following crop may be grown safely 2 years following an application: mustard* (condiment type only). Winter wheat can be grown 3 months after treatment*. There are insufficient data for other following crops. Conduct a field bioassay (a test strip grown to maturity) the year before growing any crop other than those listed above.   

* If drought conditions are experienced between June 1 and September 1 in the year of application, delay planting of winter wheat, durum wheat, canary seed, tame oats, flax, or canola (non-Clearfield) by an additional year.  If drought is received between June 1 and September 1 in the year of application OR between June 1 and September 1 in the year following application, delay planting of mustard by an additional year. In the grey, black, and dark brown soil zones, drought is defined as less than 125 mm of total precipitation between June 1 and September 1.

## Registered tank mixes   

Sortan IS (only) mixed with glyphosate herbicide at 360 g ai/acre. No surfactant required when tank mixed with glyphosate at registered rates.   

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground equipment. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre. Sortan – 40 - 80 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Sortan IS: Optimum pre-emergence weed control is achieved when it is activated with rainfall 3 to 5 days after application. Activation occurs when the top 5 to 10 cm of soil is thoroughly moistened following rainfall, and the herbicide is readily available to germinating weeds. Apply when temperature in the 24 hours before and after application ranges between 5 and 28°C. Rapid fluctuations in temperature will stress both potato and corn. For Prism SG, Hinge and Sharda Rimsulfuron, wait 48 to 72 hours after potato or corn have been injured by frost before application.   

## How it works   

Herbicide is absorbed through the foliage and inhibits cell elongation.   

## Expected result   

Prism SG/Sharda Rimsulfuron/Sortan/Hinge herbicides rapidly stop growth of susceptible species; typical symptoms usually appear within 5 to 7 days, but may not be noticeable for 2 to 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 2 to 4 hours of application may lessen degree of weed control. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crops or cut for hay; sufficient data is not available to support such use. Pre-harvest intervals: 30 days.   

Re-cropping: Barley, soybean, white bean, red clover, sorghum, sweet, seed and field corn, oats, canola, spring and durum wheat, dry bean, chickpea, sunflower, field pea, lentils, flax, faba bean and potato may be planted 10 months after application. Winter wheat may be planted 4 months after application. For all other crops, a field bioassay is recommended before planting. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Rimsulfuron herbicide is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zones specified on the label.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = > 5,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Store in a cool, dry, well ventilated room.

## Registered tank mixes   

Glyphosate at 360 g ai/acre when applied to glyphosate tolerant corn only. No surfactant required when tank mixed with glyphosate.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground applications only. Water volume: 40 L/acre minimum (optimum water volume is  55 - 80 L/acre).   

## Mixing instructions   

Half fill sprayer with water and agitate. If mixing with a WDG or dry formulation, add the dry formulation to the mixture first. Add Stellar followed by the grassy herbicide tank mix partner.   

## Application Tips   

Apply only when the temperature in the 24 hours before and after the application ranges between 5 and 30   

°   

C. Do not apply to corn that has been stressed by abnormally hot, humid or cold weather conditions, frost, low fertility, drought, previous pesticide applications, disease or insect damage. Temporary crop injury may occur. Do not tank mix with an organophosphorus insecticide. Do not apply an organophosphorus insecticide within 7 days before or after an application of Steadfast IS. Do not cultivate corn within 7 days before or after and application of Steadfast IS. Make only 1 application of Steadfast IS per year.   

## How it works   

Steadfast IS a systemic herbicide that is absorbed by the foliage and rapidly translocated to the plant’s growing points. Growth is quickly stopped in susceptible species.   

## Expected results   

Symptoms typically appear in 5 to 7 days, but may not be noticeable for 2 to 3 weeks after application depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility. Typical injury symptoms include yellowing, purpling and reddening of the newest leaves. Eventually the plant will brown and die.

Corteva Agriscience supports the following, non-registered, tank mixes. They are Traxos and Tilt. Use the most restrictive use limitations for either product.   

Stellar XL is an all-in-one formulation registered for use with all listed grass mixes. Outshine is registered for use with florasulam and MCPA or 2,4-D and is a separate package. Consult grass mixes for registrations.   

## Application information   

Water volume: Ground equipment only (40 L/acre).   

## Mixing instructions   

Half fill sprayer with water and agitate. If mixing with a WDG or dry formulation, add the dry formulation to the mixture first. Add Stellar followed by the grassy herbicide tank mix partner.   

## How it works   

Stellar XL/Outshine is readily absorbed by weed foliage. The florasulam component inhibits the ALS enzyme  in plants resulting in a rapid halt in plant growth followed by yellowing, most noticeable after 1 to 2 weeks. The fluroxypyr and MCPA components mimic plant growth regulators causing swelling and thickening and twisted weed growth followed by yellowing and browning, resulting in plant mortality.   

## Expected results   

Weeds start to discolour and twist shortly after application. Plant growth will cease or become erratic followed by browning and plant mortality.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if rainfall is expected within 2 hours of application. Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Stellar XL/Outshine can be seeded the following year to barley, canola, oats, pea or wheat or fields can be summerfallowed. Grazing: Do not cut the treated crop for hay or graze treated crop within 7 days after application.   

Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

This product has potential to leach. Do not apply excessive irrigation. Use a buffer zone of 30 mtres between area treated and sensitive habitats.   

## Toxicity   

Stellar XL/Outshine: Acute oral LD50   

(rats)> 2,000 mg/kg (males). MCPA ester: Acute oral LD50

## Registered tank mixes   

None.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 60 - 120 L/acre for pre-emergence applications. 40 L/acre for pre-plant incorporation.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions ‘a’ on page 15.   

## Application tips   

In order to activate Strim MTZ a small amount of rainfall or irrigation is required within 10 days of a pre-emergence application. In areas of low rainfall, follow pre-emergence application with a light irrigation of 0.7 to 1.27 cm of water. For pre-plant incorporation a single incorporate is satisfactory; incorporate with implements that provide uniform, shallow incorporation.   

## How it works   

Metribuzin is a systemic herbicide absorbed by leaves and roots and translocated to new growth. Metribuzin inhibits photosynthesis and the weeds turn brown and die. S-metolachlor inhibits germination of weeds, particularly grasses.   

## Expected results   

Annual grasses do not germinate, or under dry conditions germinate, but die back soon after emergence. Initial yellowing of broadleaf weeds 5 to 7 days after application, weeds turn brown and die 14 to 16 days after application. Soil residual activity for a period of time will control shallow-rooted germinants.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: No restrictions listed. Grazing: Do not graze or cut for hay. Re-cropping: Canola may be injured if planted in soil that was treated with Strim MTZ in the previous cropping year. Pre-harvest intervals: 60 days.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground sprayers or by air. Water volume: Ground application – 40 L/acre. Aerial application:  12 L/acre (minimum).   

## Application tips   

In winter wheat, spray winter annuals as soon as growth begins in spring. Use the 600 mL/acre rate when weeds are not actively growing due to extended periods of hot and dry, or cold and wet, weather prior to or following application or when weeds are beyond the 3-leaf stage or for heavy weed infestation. Do not let contents stand for long periods in the tank. Agitate every 8 hours.   

## How it works   

A combination of 3 systemic hormonal herbicides that accumulate in the growing point of susceptible plants,  produce abnormal growth and disrupt the transport system in plants.   

## Expected results   

Weeds: Can take up to 7 to 14 days depending on weather and growing conditions. Leaves curl, leaf edges turn  brown, petioles twist, plant ceases growth and turns brown and dies.   

Crop: Improper or untimely application can result in abnormal bending at the nodes of grain stalks, difficulty in head emergence from sheath, curled awns, malformed kernels and sterile florets. Under certain conditions, straw shortening may occur but yield will not be affected. Poor results may be expected if there is poor coverage, or  weeds are too advanced.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 3 hours will reduce activity. Grazing: Do not graze within 7 days of application, and do not cut for forage or hay within 30 days. Pre-harvest intervals: Leave at least 60 days from application to harvest.   

Re-cropping: Cereal and broadleaf crops can be grown the year following application.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Sword/Tracker XP are toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Use a 1-metre buffer from aquatic and 5 metre buffer from sensitive terrestrial habitats.

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground equipment or by air. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre ground or 12 - 20 L for air application.   

## Mixing instructions   

Half fill tank with water and agitate. Add Tandem A, then Tandem B, then any tank mix partner; add non-ionic surfactant, then finish filling tank.   

## Application tips   

Only weeds emerged at time of application are controlled. For optimum results, apply Tandem to actively growing seedling weeds. Weed control may be reduced if Tandem is applied under stress conditions. Do not apply to crops that are stressed as crop injury may result. Under conditions of low crop competition and high weed density or wet foliage at time of application, control may be reduced.   

## How it works   

Tandem A inhibits the production of the ALS enzyme in plants. This enzyme is essential for the production of certain amino acids, which are essential for plant growth. Tandem B is a plant growth regulator, which will cause twisting, bending and erratic growth of susceptible weeds.   

## Expected results   

Tandem rapidly stops the growth of susceptible weeds. However, typical symptoms (discolouration) of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks following application, depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility. Degree of control and duration of symptoms depend on weed sensitivity, weed size, crop competition, growing conditions following treatment and spray coverage.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rain within 2 hours of application may reduce control. Grazing: Livestock may be grazed on treated crops 7 days following application. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application.   

Re-cropping: Eleven months following an application of Tandem, the following crops can be seeded: barley, brown mustard, canola, dry bean (of the species Phaseolus vulgaris), flax, canola quality Brassica juncea, lentil, oat, field pea, chickpea, spring wheat, soybean and yellow mustard, sunflower or summerfallowed.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Simplicity is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Avoid contamination of these sensitive areas by using the recommended buffer of 1 metre from water bodies and 2 metres from sensitive terrestrial areas.   

## Toxicity   

Tandem A: Acute LD50

## Remarks   

## Krovar + non-ionic surfactant   

Telar: 48 g/acre + Krovar: 2.75 - 3.6 kg/acre + Non-ionic surfactant: 1% v/v   

Apply when weeds are small (less than  10 cm tall)   

## Application information   

With: Ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: Not less than 40 L/acre. Spray volumes of  80 - 160 L/acre are recommended.   

## Application tips   

Select a spray volume that will ensure thorough coverage and uniform spray pattern. Best results are obtained when weeds are actively growing.   

## How it works   

Absorbed through the roots and foliage. Inhibits cell elongation.   

## Expected results   

Telar rapidly inhibits growth of susceptible weeds. Typical symptoms (discolouration) of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application depending on growing conditions and weed susceptibility. Degree of control and duration of effect depend on the following factors: rate used, weed sensitivity and weed size, growing conditions at and following treatment, precipitation, soil organic matter and pH.

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 2 hours may lessen degree of weed control. For best results, sufficient rainfall to move  Telar 5 to 7 cm deep into the soil is required after application before weeds develop an established root system  and grow beyond the seedling stage. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Telar is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zones specified under  Directions for Use on the label.

Apply ThunderHawk prior to the emergence of the crop, either as a pre-seed or pre-emergence application and no longer than 48 hours after seeding prior to any crop emergence. Only weeds that have emerged at the time of application will be controlled.   

## How it works   

ThunderHawk A is designed for use as a contact and systemic herbicide for broadleaf weed control. Pyraflufen-ethyl, a member of the phenyl pyrazole class of herbicides, inhibits the protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) enzyme which results in cell membrane destruction and necrosis.   

MCPA, a member of the phenoxy class of herbicides, mimics the plant growth regulator indol-3-acetic acid (auxin), interfering with cell enlargement and division, and development in susceptible plants. ThunderHawk B inhibits the production of the ALS enzyme in plants. This enzyme is essential for the production of certain amino acids that are essential for plant growth.   

## Expected results   

Contact activity will be apparent within hours. Initially, leaves will take on a water-soaked appearance before turning necrotic; systemic symptomology will appear over time. Plants will be necrotic and may exhibit epinasty (twisting) before death. Complete plant death will occur within a few days. However, for certain weeds controlled by ThunderHawk B, typical symptoms (discolouration) of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 2 weeks after application, depending upon growing conditions and weed susceptibility.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 2 hours of application may reduce control. Grazing: Do not permit lactating dairy animals to graze field within 7 days of application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields 3 days before slaughter.   

Re-cropping: Fields treated with ThunderHawk in the spring may be planted to barley, oats, wheat, durum.   

Pre-harvest Intervals: Do not graze or cut treated crops for forage until 30 days after application.   

## Re-entry interval: 12 hours   

## Environmental precautions   

Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast or to areas with steep slopes, and/or compacted clay soils. Overspray or drift to sensitive habitats should be avoided. A buffer zone of 30 meters is required near sensitive habitats.   

## Toxicity   

T Pyraflufen-ethyl: Acute oral LD50

## Application tips   

Do not treat cereals underseeded with forages. For best results, spray when weeds are in the seedling stage and actively growing. Application before the 4-leaf stage may injure the crop.   

## How it works   

Bromoxynil is a contact type herbicide; therefore, good spray coverage is essential. Inhibits photosynthesis and plant respiration. 2,4-D is a hormone type herbicide which causes abnormal growth, affects respiration, food reserves and cell division in broadleaf plants. Absorbed primarily by leaves and stems and translocated to the growing tips and roots.   

## Expected results   

Small burn spots on the leaf can appear within hours; death takes up to 2 weeks.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour of application may reduce weed control. Grazing: Do not graze or harvest for greenfeed until 30 days after treatment. Withdraw meat animals 3 days before slaughter. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest within 30 days of application. Re-cropping: There are no re-cropping restrictions the year after application.   

Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Bromoxynil + 2,4-D is toxic to small mammals, birds, aquatic organisms including fish and non-target terrestrial plants. Avoid contamination of sensitive areas by using appropriate buffer zones.

## Application information   

With: Ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Only use sprayers that have good agitation. Ensure the sprayer is properly cleaned prior to adding Topline.  Use mixing instructions “b” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Do not apply to crops underseeded to legumes. Apply Topline early post-emergence to the main flush of broadleaf weeds. Warm, moist conditions that promote active weed growth, small weed size and competitive crop and good growing conditions after application will optimize the weed control. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed, and regrowth may occur. For best results, ensure adequate spray coverage of the target weeds. Only weeds that are emerged at time of application will be controlled.  If the foliage of the weed is wet at the time of application, control may be reduced.   

## How it works   

Topline herbicides contains a Group 2 and a Group 4 mode of action herbicide. The Group 2 mode of action herbicide inhibits the production of the ALS enzyme in plants. This enzyme is essential for the production of certain amino acids required for plant growth. The Group 4 mode of action herbicide disrupts normal plant growth regulation, resulting in death of susceptible plants.   

## Expected results   

Weeds susceptible to Topline will stop growing almost immediately. The weeds turn yellow or reddish. Symptoms such as yellowing and red colouration may not be noticeable for 1 to 2 weeks. Some twisting may also be observed on weeds sensitive to MCPA. Warm, moist conditions, small weed size and competitive crop will optimize weed control provided by Topline.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Heavy rainfall immediately after application may wash the chemical off the foliage, and a repeat treatment may be required. Do not apply if rainfall is forecast for the time of application. Grazing: Do not permit lactating dairy animals to graze fields within 7 days after application. Do not harvest forage or cut hay within 7 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter.   

Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Re-cropping: Barley, canola, pea, wheat or fields can be fallowed.   

## Environmental precautions   

Highly toxic to aquatic organisms and non-terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zones specified under Directions for  Use on the label.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

is > 2,000 mg/kg.

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground sprayers, backpack sprayers or handgun. See label for application information for a backpack sprayer. Water volume: 160 - 324 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Tordon 22K is persistent. It will carry over in soil. Treated soil should not be moved out of the treated area. Tordon 22K is very difficult to clean from sprayers. Use a different sprayer for applying other materials to desirable plants or crops. Handguns equipped with proportioning devices and reservoirs for Tordon 22K are useful in preventing sprayer contamination. Spot treatment: Treat at rate of 90 mL/100 m2. May be used to treat no more than a 1 acre patch.   

## How it works   

Interferes with cell division, causing leaf cupping, stem distortion and eventual death of plant. Tordon 22K is absorbed through leaves and roots.   

## Expected results   

Tordon 22K: Perennial weeds show distorted stems and cupped leaves, which turn yellow and then brown.  Usually native grass increases in abundance as a result of reduced competition.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Heavy rainfall shortly after application may cause poor results.

Grazing: Do not graze treated area by dairy animals within 6 weeks after treatment. Clippings from grass or crops which have been treated with Tordon 22K should not be used for composting or mulching, nor should the manure from animals grazing treated areas or fed treated forage be used around susceptible plants. Re-cropping: Picloram may persist in the soil for a period of up to 5 years; therefore, it should not be used in those areas where sensitive broadleaved crops such as sunflower and potato are grown in the rotations. Where wheat, oats or barley are the major crops in the rotations, it is recommended oats are grown in the first year, oat or barley the second year, then oats, barley or wheat the third year after treatment. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Buffer zones are 1 metre for aquatic habitats and 120 metres for sensitive terrestrial habitats. Tordon 22K is moderately toxic to fish. Do not apply to any water bodies or in areas where the runoff from treated areas will reach fish-bearing waters. Leaching: Picloram is highly mobile in the soil and will readily move with water.  Do not apply to soils that are very permeable.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water Volume: 40 L/acre minimum.   

Do not apply more than 607 mL/acre Tough EC Herbicide per season.   

## Application tips   

Tough EC must be applied to emerged, actively growing weeds. Warm, moist growing conditions promote active weed growth and enhance the activity of pyridate. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed and re-growth may occur. For best results, ensure thorough spray coverage of target weeds.   

## How it works   

Tough EC is a contact herbicide. It is absorbed through the leaves of actively growing plants inhibiting photosynthesis by disrupting the photosystem II complex.   

## Expected results   

Symptoms in sensitive weeds include marginal yellowing, followed by yellowing and browning of the entire leaf, usually occurring within 4 - 7 days after application.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 22 L/acre minimum.  Aerial – 10 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

Optimal herbicide activity requires an actively growing crop and weeds. Best temperature for application is  between 12 and 24°C. Products work through maximum foliar uptake and contact activity. Frost 3 days before or after application may reduce weed control and crop tolerance. Consult label for mixing instructions. Shake well before using.   

## How it works   

A mix of 3 active ingredients from 2 modes of action. The thifensulfuron and metsulfuron methyls are absorbed by foliage and roots, translocating throughout the plants and concentrating in areas of rapid growth. There, they inhibit cell division. Fluroxypyr is a Group 4 herbicide, an artificial plant hormone, that disrupts normal growth, causing plant twisting and eventual death.   

## Expected results   

Growth stops immediately. Discolouration of dying weeds may not be noticeable for 1 to 3 weeks after application, depending on growing conditions and weed species. Poor results may be expected if there is improper mixing, timing, coverage or when weeds are under drought stress.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast in 2 hours. Grazing: Do not graze or feed the treated crop to livestock within 7 days of application. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days of application.   

Re-cropping: The following crops may be seeded 10 months after application: canola, dry bean, flax, faba bean, field corn, soybean, oat, pea, spring wheat (including durum), spring barley ,winter wheat, lentil.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Buffer zone of 1 to 5 metres for ground application from sensitive aquatic and terrestrial habitat. Avoid spraying areas potentially susceptible to runoff.

1 Always consult the label of the broadleaf herbicide, insecticide or fungicide prior to use. 2 Rates above 2.0 L/ha may cause crop injury. 3 Refer to broadleaf tank mix label for list of weeds controlled at low and high use rates. 4 A reduction in barnyard grass control may be observed when Traxos herbicide is tank mixed with these broadleaf herbicides. 5 A reduction in green foxtail control may be observed when Traxos herbicide is tank mixed  with these broadleaf herbicides.   

## Application information   

Water volume: Ground – 20 - 40 L/acre. Aerial – 12 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Half fill tank with water using continuous agitation. Add tank mix partner, then add Traxos. Agitate for several minutes between application of herbicides.   

## Application tips   

When tank mixing Traxos herbicide with a tank mix partner, ensure you read the tank mix partner label for minimum water recommendations. For optimum control, apply Traxos herbicide to actively growing weeds, ideally at the  2 - 3 leaf stage. An early application will maximize crop yields by reducing weed competition. Weeds emerging after application of Traxos herbicide will not be controlled.   

Weed control under stress conditions can be reduced or delayed. Do not apply to crop that is stressed by conditions such as frost, low fertility, drought, flooding, disease or insect damage as crop injury may result.   

## How it works   

Traxos herbicide is absorbed by the leaves and is rapidly translocated to the growing points of leaves and stems. Thorough coverage of the plants is essential for consistent control.   

## Expected results   

Actively growing susceptible grasses stop growing within 48 hours of treatment. Depending on species, growing conditions and crop competition, leaves and growing points turn yellow within 1 to 3 weeks after application. Further colour changes and loss of vigour will be observed, followed by a browning and complete control 3 to 5 weeks after application. Temporary crop injury may occur with tank mixes under extreme weather conditions or when the crop is suffering from stress due to inadequate or abnormally high moisture levels or extreme temperatures.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Traxos herbicide alone can be used 1 hour before rainfall. Grazing: Observe a minimum of 7 days before grazing livestock. Pre-harvest intervals: 60 days after treatment for grain and straw and 30 days after  for hay. Re-cropping: There are no crop limitations the year following application of Traxos.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application tips   

Application before the 4-leaf stage of wheat may cause severe twisting of leaves and stem and head deformities, which may reduce yield up to 10%. Do not apply later than the flag leaf stag. Maximum 1 application per year.   

## How it works   

Actively growing susceptible grasses stop growing within 48 hours of treatment. Depending on species, growing conditions and crop competition, leaves and growing points turn yellow within 1 to 2 weeks of application.   

## Expected results   

Depending on species, growing conditions and crop competition, leaves and growing points turn yellow within 1 to 2 weeks of application. Further colour changes and loss of vigour will be observed, followed by browning and complete control within 3 to 5 weeks. The TraxosTwo Broadleaf Component is influenced by weather conditions. Optimum activity requires active crop and weed growth. The temperature range for optimum activity is 12 to 24°C. Reduced activity will occur when temperatures are below 8°C or above 27°C. Frost before an application (3 days) or shortly after may reduce weed control and crop tolerance. Weed control may be reduced during stress conditions, e.g., drought, heat or cold stress, or if weeds have initiated flowering or if heavy infestation exists.   

## Restrictions   

Do not apply on barley or any crop other than spring wheat or durum, as crop damage will result. Do not allow spray to drift to adjacent fields seeded to crops other than spring wheat or durum wheat. Do not treat wheat underseeded to forage. Rainfall: Do not apply within 2 hours of rainfall. Grazing: Do not permit lactating dairy/beef animals to fields within 7 days of application. Do not harvest for grain or straw until 60 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from fields at least 3 days before slaughter. Re-cropping: Fields treated with TraxosTwo can be replanted to wheat, barley, oats, triticale, alfalfa, edible bean, canola, lentil, pea, potato, soybean, sugar beet and sunflower.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms, birds, small wild mammals and non-target terrestrial plants. Buffer zones: Field sprayer – 1 metre for fresh water, estuarine/marine habitats and terrestrial habitats. Aerial – 5 metres for fixed wing and 2 metres for rotary wing for fresh water and 1 metre for estuarine/marine habitats. 50 metres for fixed wing and 45 metres for rotary wing for terrestrial habitats.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Water volume: 20 - 40 L/acre   

## Application tips   

For optimum control, apply herbicide to actively growing weeds. Only weeds emerged at time of application will be controlled. Weed control may be reduced if applied under stress conditions such as drought, heat, prolonged cool temperatures, flooding and insufficient fertility. Under conditions of low crop and high weed density, control may be reduced. Optimum weed control will be obtained if application of Tridem herbicide is delayed until the stress conditions have ended and the weeds have resumed growth.   

## How it works   

Tridem is absorbed by the leaves and rapidly translocated to the growing points and stems. Warm, moist growing conditions promote active weed growth and enhance the activity of Tridem by allowing maximum foliar uptake  and activity.   

## Expected results   

Actively growing, susceptible weeds stop growing. Depending on grass species, growing conditions and crop competition, leaf discolouration occurs within 1 to 3 weeks after application. Degree of grass control.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rain within 1 hour of application may reduce control. Grazing: Do not graze for 7 days or silage/hay for 30 days following application. Pre-Harvest interval: Do not harvest the treated crop for grain within 60 days of application. Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Tridem herbicide can be seeded the following year to alfalfa, barley, canola, corn, dry common beans, faba bean, flax, lentils, mustard (brown, oriental, and/or yellow), oats, pea, potato (except seed potato), soybean, sunflower, wheat or field can be summer-fallowed.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not contaminate any body of water. Use a downwind buffer zone of 30 metres between boom edge and the closest edge of sensitive terrestrial habitat and a 15 metre buffer zone between the downwind edge of the boom and the closest edge of sensitive aquatic habitat.

Spring application: Trifluralin can be applied immediately prior to planting or up to 3 weeks before planting.   

Summer application: Trifluralin can be applied to summerfallow between June 1 and Sept. 1 for weed control in canola or flax the following year. Apply the summer rate and incorporate (see Incorporation section). Not recommended for sand and sandy loam soils. Trifluralin must be incorporated at least twice with the implement operated in 2 different directions. The initial incorporation must be done within 24 hours after application. The second incorporation (and subsequent incorporations) may be done whenever necessary to destroy resistant weed growth during the remainder of the fallow season. Shallow tillage (5 - 8 cm) is necessary in the spring prior to planting.   

Summerfallow: Treflan MicroActiv/Bonanza 10G/Rival 10G can also be applied to summerfallow in May, June or July for weed control during both years of a fallow-wheat rotation or in the fall (Sept.: prior to soil freeze-up) prior to spring and durum wheat seeding.

within 24 hours of application. Second at the right angle to the first and should be delayed a minimum of 3 to 5 days. For best results, perform both incorporations in the fall followed by tillage (5 to 8 cm) in the spring prior to planting.   

Summer (May to July): The initial incorporation must be done within 24 hours of application. The second incorporation (and subsequent incorporations) may be done whenever necessary to destroy resistant weed growth during the remainder of the summerfallow.   

Fall applied liquids: All liquid formulations must be incorporated at least twice with the implement operated in 2 different directions. The initial incorporation must be done within 24 hours after application. The second incorporation (and subsequent incorporations) may be done whenever necessary to destroy resistant weed growth during the remainder of the fallow season. Shallow tillage (5 - 8 cm) is necessary in the spring prior to planting.   

Fall applied granules in wheat and barley: Granules can be applied in the fall between Sept. 1 and prior to soil freeze-up for the control of green foxtail in the following year. Granules should be applied to standing stubble or pre-worked stubble. The initial incorporation must be done within 24 hours of application. For best results, it is recommended to do both incorporations in the fall followed by tillage (5 - 8 cm) in the spring prior to planting.   

Caution: Fall application is not recommended in situations where lack of trash cover combined with required incorporation would leave the soil exposed to erosion.   

Spring granules (in year of seeding): Granular formulations: incorporate twice in cross directions using a tandem disc, tandem disc, discer or field (vibrashank type) cultivator set to work 8 to 10 cm for the first incorporation. The first incorporation should be done as soon as possible after application, but can be delayed up to 24 hours. The second incorporation can be delayed for at least 3 to 5 days following the first incorporation. This allows time for greater release of granular trifluralin onto soil particles and assures more uniform distribution in soil.   

Spring liquid formulations in canola and specialty crops: (in year of seeding) must be incorporated at least twice with the implement operated in 2 different directions. The initial incorporation must be done within 24 hours after application. The second incorporation should be a discing or cultivation in a cross direction at the same depth any time prior to planting. Shallow tillage (5 to 8 cm) is necessary in the spring prior to planting.   

Spring liquid formulations in wheat and barley: Liquid formulations must be applied after seeding and shallowly (2 to 4 cm), incorporated with tyne or diamond tooth harrows into trash-free soil, operating at a minimum speed of 9 km/hr. The first incorporation should be performed in the same direction of application. The second incorporation should be performed at the right angle to the first. Both incorporations should be done within 24 hrs of application.   

## Application tips   

Do not apply on soils that are wet, in poor tilth and contain 15% or more organic matter. Do not apply on soils with less than 2% organic matter. Application to severely eroded knolls is not recommended.   

Do not apply to fields spread with manure during past 12 months. Do not apply to soils that are subjected to long-term flooding. Do not apply granular formulation on stubble in the fall for wheat when the crop harvested in the current calendar year was treated with trifluralin-based products. This includes applications made in the previous summer or fall. Seed into a firm, moist, weed-free seedbed using a double disc press drill or hoe drill set to seed  3 to 6 cm deep. If a discer or air seeder is used for seeding, separate spring tillage may not be necessary.  However, care must be exercised such that the discer or air seeder is set to uniformly place the seed 3 to 6 cm deep and the seedbed should be firmly packed or harrowed after seeding to promote good germination. Wheat: Avoid deep seeding, loose seedbeds and seeding into cold soils. When seeding semi-dwarf wheat, special care should be taken to ensure shallow seeding. Apply only on trash-free or summerfallow fields. Flax and lentils: Shallowly till and pack the soil in the spring to ensure a firm seedbed and accurate depth of seeding. Seed into well-packed and moist seedbed. Do not seed deeper than 4 cm.   

## How it works   

Kills weed seedlings as they germinate. Inhibits cell division in the actively growing points of roots ands shoots.   

## Expected results   

Most weeds die before emerging. Weeds will exhibit swelling at the coleoptile region, stubby thick primary root development and lack of secondary roots, which leads to death due to inadequate moisture absorbing ability.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: No effect once trifluralin is incorporated into the soil. Re-cropping: Oats, sugar beet and small-seeded grasses such as timothy, canaryseed grass and creeping red fescue should not be grown in rotation following a crop treated with trifluralin based products. Do not seed wheat as a rotational crop if trifluralin and/or ethalfluralin have been used at an oilseed/special crop/barley rate for 2 consecutive crops.

Do not direct seed (zero till) a rotational crop into standing stubble on land that has been treated with trifluralin or ethalfluralin for the previous crop. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crop or cut for hay; there is not sufficient data to support such use.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Trifluralin is considered non-toxic to bees. Trifluralin is considered highly toxic to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, and essentially non-toxic to birds. Trifluralin is absorbed by the soil and is resistant to leaching.

## Application information   

With: Apply with ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Half fill tank with water, agitate continually, add Trophy A/Foxxy, then Trophy B/MPower MCPA, then complete filling with water.   

## Application tips   

Spray under optimal conditions, which includes temperatures ranging from 12 to 24°C. Reduced activity will occur with temperatures below 8°C or above 27°C. Frost shortly before application or shortly after application may reduce weed control and crop tolerance. Weed control may be reduced during stress conditions. Wet foliage at time of application may result in reduced weed control. Application on cleavers can be made up to 6-whorl (20 cm height) stage. Do not apply to wheat and barley underseeded to legumes. Make only 1 application per year. Application prior to 3-leaf stage of wheat and barley may cause severe twisting of leaves and leaf stem and head deformities, which may reduce yield. Do not apply later than flag leaf stage of crop.   

## How it works   

Trophy/Rush M herbicide tank mix is non-residual. The components of Trophy/Foxxy M tank mix move within the plant to control exposed and underground plant tissue. It mimics naturally occurring plant hormones and controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms include twisting of stems and swollen nodes.   

## Expected results   

Weeds start to twist shortly after spraying. After twisting and bending, plants stop growing, turn brown and die.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply if rain is expected in 1 hour. Grazing: Do not permit any grazing or cut for hay within 7 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter.   

Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest the treated crop within 60 days after application.   

Re-cropping: Fields previously treated with Trophy/Foxxy M herbicide tank mix can be seeded the following year to wheat, barley, oats, rye forage grasses, flax, lentil, pea, canola and mustard or summerfallow. Do not seed crops other than those listed above for at least 1 year following treatment. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## How it works   

A systemic, absorbed by leaves and stems and translocated to actively growing regions. It disrupts cell division, stops cell growth and interferes with respiration and food reserves. Selectivity based on ability of plant to efficiently convert MCPB to MCPA.   

## Expected results   

Broadleaf weeds should be dead within 2 to 3 weeks of treatment. Poor results and/or crop injury may be expected if Water volume is incorrect or weeds are too mature.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall before the foliage has dried from the spraying may decrease activity. Grazing: Seedling forage grasses – do not graze the treated crop or cut for hay in the year of establishment. All other crops: Do not permit lactating dairy animals to graze fields within 7 days after application. Do not harvest for forage or cut hay within 7 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter.   

Re-cropping: None. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

Temporary crop injury may be observed when AMS is included for enhanced broadleaf weed control.   

Bayer supports the following mixes that are not on the Tundra label. These are MCPA ester, Lontrel, Decis and Sevin XLR, all on spring  and durum wheat and barley; Tilt on spring wheat and barley. Apply mixes according to the most restrictive use limitations for either product.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 19 L/acre. Aerial – 11.3 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Fill the spray tank ¼ to ½ full with clean water and begin agitation. If mixing with AMS, add to the tank first.  Add the appropriate amount of Tundra herbicide. Fill the spray tank with the balance of water required. Maintain sufficient agitation throughout mixing and application.   

## Application tips   

Use higher water volumes under conditions of heavy crop or weed canopies. For best results apply to young, actively growing weeds. Under cool, dry conditions, activity may be reduced or delayed. Activity may be affected if weeds are dust covered or covered in heavy dew, mist or rain. Do not apply to a stressed crop but apply after plants resume normal growth.   

## How it works   

Tundra is composed of 3 herbicides active ingredients, fenoxaprop-p-ethyl, bromoxynil and pyrasulfotole. Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl works by contact and systemically. It moves to the roots and shoots and kills the growing point. Pyrasulfatole is also systemic, inhibiting plant pigment formation and photosynthesis. Bromoxynil is a contact herbicide, inhibiting respiration and photosynthesis.   

## Expected results   

Typical symptoms include broadleaf weeds turning brown and dying within 3 to 5 days, reduced grassy leaf growth and chlorotic blotching within 3 days of application followed by leaf chlorosis and complete death by 2 to 3 weeks and leaf bleaching.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 1 hour of application may reduce effectiveness. Grazing: Do not graze or cut the treated crop for hay within 25 days of application. Pre-harvest intervals: Leave at least 65 days from application to harvest.   

Re-cropping: Alfalfa, barley, canary seed, canola, flax, (including low linolenic acid varieties) field pea*, tame oats, spring wheat including durum, potatoes and sunflowers may be planted 10 months after application. Lentils can be grown 22 months after application. Use a field bioassay for crops not listed above. Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

* Field pea may be grown the year following Infinity application in all Black, Gray-Wooded and Dark Brown soil zones. Do not plant field peas the year following Infinity application in the Brown soil zone where organic matter content is less than 2.5% and soil pH is above 7.5. Use a field bioassay for crops not listed above.

## Environmental precautions   

Tundra is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Leave at least a 15-metre buffer zone around sensitive terrestrial and aquatic habitats.   

## Toxicity   

Toxic to aquatic organisms and sensitive terrestrial plants. Use of a hand-held backpack sprayer, inter-row hooded sprayer, spot treatment, soil drench and soil incorporation require no buffer zones. Otherwise, use recommended buffer zones of 3 to 10 metres when using ground application, 1 to 375 metres by air.

## Application tips   

Ultra Blazer and the tank mix of Ultra Blazer + Basagran or Basagran Forte provide the best weed control when maximum daily temperatures are expected to be above 21°C.   

## How it works   

Acifluorfen is a contact herbicide that inhibits protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO). Cell membrane damaged induced by inhibition of PPO leads to plant death.   

## Expected results   

Effects on susceptible weeds can be observed within 1 - 2 hours. Symptoms include water-soaking, speckling, leaf curling, and bronzing turning to necrosis.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rain within 6 hours may reduce effectiveness. Grazing: Do not graze or cut for hay. Re-cropping: No restrictions listed. Pre-harvest intervals: No restrictions listed. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Do not apply through any type of irrigation equipment.   

Water volume: Minimum of 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “b” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

Applications should be made 5 to10 days apart or as weeds germinate. Weeds should be actively growing and not under stress. For best results, apply to small, emerged weeds between the cotyledon and 4 true leaf stage at approximately 5 cm tall or across. Applications made to larger weeds or to weeds under stress may result in unsatisfactory control. Since UpBeet has little or no soil activity, only weeds that have emerged above the soil surface will be controlled. Use sequential tank mix applications to control new weed flushes. Timely cultivation(s) can be used in addition to UpBeet tank mixes for optimum weed control in a sugar beet management program. Dry, dusty field conditions may reduce weed control in wheel track areas. Higher water volumes may improve control in these conditions.   

## How it works   

Absorbed through foliage. Inhibits cell elongation.   

## Expected results   

UpBeet herbicide rapidly stops the growth of susceptible weeds; weeds turn yellow usually 7 to 21 days after post-emergent application, followed by the death of the growing plant. Cool and/or dry conditions may reduce or delay herbicidal activity. Large weeds or weeds stressed due to frost, drought or water-saturated soil, disease or insect damage may not be controlled adequately.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Grazing: No restrictions on grazing or feeding of crop residue to livestock. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not apply within 60 days of harvest.   

Re-cropping: In case of crop failure, only sugar beets may be replanted 30 days after application of UpBeet. However, if a total of 100 g/ha of UpBeet has already been applied to the first crop of sugar beets, then no more UpBeet may be applied to the second crop of sugar beets. Cereal crops (spring wheat, durum wheat, winter wheat, barley) may be planted the following year after application of UpBeet. For all other crops, a field bioassay must be conducted.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Leave a 1-metre buffer around freshwater habitats and  3 metres near sensitive land habitats.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = > 5,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

To prevent contamination, store away from food or feed.

## Valtera EZ/Chateau EZ(cont’d)   

## Application tips   

Significant crop injury may occur from applications made to poorly drained soils and/or applications made under cool, wet conditions. Severe crop injury will result when soils are flooded following applications of Chateau EZ or Valtera EZ. Treated soil that is splashed onto newly emerged crops may result in temporary crop injury.   

Valtera EZ should be tank mixed with glyphosate and/or other tank mix partners to control any emerged weeds at the time of application. Glyphosate can also be tank mixed with Valtera EZ and Nufram Enhance for desiccation applications. Moisture is necessary to activate Valtera EZ/Chateau EZ in soil for residual weed control. Dry weather following applications of Valtera EZ/Chateau EZ may reduce effectiveness.   

ChateauEZ/Valtera EZ may not control weeds that germinate after application but before an activating rainfall/irrigation or weeds that germinate through cracks resulting from dry soil.   

## How it works   

Flumioxazin controls weeds by inhibiting protoporphyrinogen oxidase, an essential enzyme required by plants for chlorophyll biosynthesis. Seedling weeds are controlled pre-emergence when exposed to sunlight following contact with the soil applied herbicide. Pre-emergence weed control with Valtera EZ/Chateau EZ is most effective when applied to clean, weed-free soil surfaces. Disturbing soil surfaces after application may reduce herbicide efficacy.   

## Expected results   

Will prevent growth of susceptible weeds.   

## Restrictions   

Mechanical incorporation into the soil or disturbance of the soil surface will reduce weed control. Do not apply more than 45 mL/acre Chateau EZ during a single growing season with potato. Chateau EZ may be applied to potato after hilling for the pre-emergence suppression of labelled weeds. A minimum of 5 cm of soil must cover the vegetative portion of the potato plant at the time of Chateau EZ application. Application to potato with less than 5 cm of soil covering the vegetative portion of the potato may result in unacceptable crop injury. Suppression of the weeds that emerge post-hilling will not be achieved if applications are made prior to hilling. Crop injury may occur if Chateau EZ is applied at hilling. Grazing: Valtera EZ – field corn – do not permit livestock to graze fields within 93 days after application. Do not harvest as green feed or silage within 93 days after application. Alfalfa – do not harvest or graze within 25 days after application. Soybean – do not harvest as green feed or permit livestock to graze fields within 21 days after application. Do not cut hay/fodder within 50 days after application. Wheat – do not harvest as green feed or permit livestock to graze fields within 26 days after application. Do not cut hay/fodder within 52 days after application. For all other crops – do not graze, cut or feed treated crops to livestock. Chateau EZ – do not graze treated fields or feed treated forage or hay to livestock. Re-cropping: Valtera EZ/Chateau EZ – for use rate 45 – 60 mL/acre – 7 days for winter wheat. For use rate 60 mL/acre – soybean, field corn, chickpea, field pea – no restrictions. Sunflower – 30 days. Spring wheat, winter wheat, lentils (small red and large green varieties) – 7 days. Durum wheat – 30 days. Barley - 3 months. Sorghum, dry common bean and canola – 9 months. Alfafa – 11 months. All other crops not listed – 12 months.

## Roadside vegetation control   

Vanquish/VMD 480 can be used in a tank mix with glyphosate (356 g/L formulation) for annual vegetation control on 1 - 2 metre wide roadside shoulders. Vanquish tank mixes with glyphosate and 2,4-D offer a broader spectrum  of total control of roadside vegetation. Apply to actively growing weeds between May and July at following rates:   

Vanquish/VMD 480: 0.5 - 1 L/acre + glyphosate (356 g/L formulation); 0.3 - 0.4 L/acre or Vanquish/VMD 480;  121 mL/acre + 2,4-D amine 500; 485 mL/acre + glyphosate (356 g/L formulation); 0.3 - 0.4 L/acre.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground: Turf weeds: 45 L/acre;  Weeds: 45 - 90 L/acre; Brush: rate/1,000 L of water. Aircraft: 35 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

Thorough coverage of weed and wetting brush to the point of runoff are essential for control. Brush and trees over  2 metres should be cut and regrowth sprayed. Do not use on bentgrass. Do not rake, mow or water turf within 24 hours after treatment. 2,4-D ester tank mix may improve brush control, especially under drought stress. Tank mix with 2,4-D (amine or ester) for control of a broader range of weeds. Avoid spraying if temperatures exceed 30°C,  to reduce risk of vapour drift. Avoid spraying onto soil over root system of desirable trees and shrubs. Thoroughly clean application equipment after use.   

## How it works   

Dicamba is a systemic herbicide absorbed through roots or leaves and translocated in most plants. Disrupts the metabolic and growth activities in the plant.   

## Expected results   

Excellent control of brush can be expected within a year of application. Effect on broadleaf weeds may be seen in 10 to 14 days with twisting and bending of main stem, cupping of leaves, increase in root size and increase in fibrous roots.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall 4 hours after application will not reduce effectiveness. Grazing: Do not permit lactating dairy animals to graze fields within 7 days after application. Do not harvest forage or cut hay within 30 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Vanquish is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = > 3,512 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Heated storage not required. Freezing may cause crystalization but no activity is lost if completely resuspended.

Apply mixes according to the most restrictive use limitations for either product.   

## Rate   

Varro: 0.2 L/acre.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Apply with ground equipment or by air. Water volume: Ground – minimum 18.9 L/acre.  Air – minimum 11.3 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Under drought conditions, do not apply if there is > 35 days between seeding and spraying, as drought hastens  crop development. Do not apply to crop that is under stress due to abnormal environmental conditions such as frost, extreme heat, low fertility, drought, flooding or disease and/or insect damage as crop injury may result. Do not  spray Varro 3 days prior to or following cold temperatures (3°C or lower) Do not apply to crops underseeded  to legumes. Apply only once per season.   

Do not use Varro if another Group 2 grass herbicide has been previously applied in the same season. For best results, apply to emerged, young, actively growing weeds. Weed control may also be reduced if application is made when weeds are dust covered or in the presence of heavy dew, fog or mist/rain.   

## How it works   

Varro: Thiencarbazone-methyl: Uptake is primarily via foliage and is transported to areas on new shoot growth  where it inhibits the enzyme acetolactate synthase (ALS). Inhibition of this enzyme prevents protein production, which leads to gradual death of target weeds.   

## Expected results   

Growth of susceptible plants stops rapidly. After a few days, plants develop chlorotic discolouration on the leaves, which sometimes turn red. Complete control may take 2 to 4 weeks.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 60 minutes of application may reduce effectiveness. Grazing: Do not graze  the treated crop or cut for forage within 7 days or cut for hay within 30 days after application. Pre-harvest intervals:   

Do not harvest spring or durum wheat for grain or straw within 60 days of application. Do not harvest winter wheat for grain or straw within 72 days of application. Re-cropping: The following crops can be planted 10 months after application – alfalfa, barley, canary seed, field corn, canola, chickpea, dry bean, flax (including low linolenic acid varieties), lentil, mustard, oats, field pea, soybean, sunflower, timothy, wheat (spring, durum and winter). Use a field bioassay for crops not listed above. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

This product is toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zones of 1 metre with ground application.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = > 2,000 mg/kg.

## Velocity m3 All‑In‑One (cont’d)   

## Application information   

How to apply: Apply with ground equipment or by air. Water volume: Ground – minimum 18.9 L/acre.  Air – minimum 11.3 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Under DROUGHT conditions, do not spray Velocity M3 if time between seeding and spraying exceeds 35 days as (drought hastens crop development). Do not spray Velocity M3 3 days prior to or following cold temperatures (3°C or lower). Do not apply to crops underseeded to legumes. Do not use Velocity m3 if another Group 2 grass herbicide has been previously applied in the same season. For best results, apply to emerged, young, actively growing weeds. Weed control may also be reduced if application is made when weeds are dust covered or in the presence of heavy dew, fog, mist or rain. Do not apply to crop that is under stress due to abnormal environmental conditions such as frost, extreme heat, low fertility, drought, flooding or disease and/or insect damage as crop injury may result. Apply only once per season.   

## How it works   

Thiencarbazone-methyl: Uptake is primarily via foliage and is transported to areas on new shoot growth where it inhibits the enzyme acetolactate synthase (ALS). Inhibition of this enzyme prevents protein production, which leads to gradual death of target weeds.   

Pyrasulfotole: Absorbed through leaves and is translocated to meristematic regions where it inhibits the HPPD enzyme. Pyrasulfotole inhibits plant pigment biosynthesis and photosynthesis. Bromoxynil: Works on contact, interfering with photosynthesis, disrupting plant growth, which ultimately leads to the plant’s death.   

## Expected results   

Grass weeds: Growth of susceptible plants stops rapidly, and after a few days plants, develop chlorotic discolouration on the leaves, which sometimes turn red. Complete control may take 2 to 4 weeks.   

Broadleaf weeds: Small burnt spots on leaf can appear in hours. Lack of plant pigments shuts down the photosynthetic pathway resulting in bleaching symptoms and rapid death, normally in 6 to 14 days.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 60 minutes of application may reduce effectiveness. Grazing: Do not graze the treated crop or cut for forage within 25 days or cut for hay within 30 days of application. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest spring or durum wheat for grain or straw within 60 days of application. Do not harvest winter wheat for grain or straw within 72 days of application. Re-cropping: The following crops can be planted 10 months after application – alfalfa, barley, canary seed, canola, flax (including low linolenic acid varieties), field pea*, oats, spring, winter and durum wheat and sunflower. The following crops can be planted 22 months after application – lentils, potato. Use a field bioassay for crops not listed above. Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

* Field pea may be grown the year following Velocity m3 application in all Black, Grey Wooded and Dark Brown soil zones. DO NOT plant field peas the year following a Velocity m3 application in the Brown soil zone where organic matter content is below 2.5 % and where soil pH is above 7.5.

## Application information   

How to apply: Apply with ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 81 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

Do not apply to frozen soils or soils with less than 1% soil organic matter. Do not use on fields that will be seeded to other crops within 24 months of application. Avoid treating fields that may be subject to erosion following improved weed control or areas of fields that are wet or poorly drained. Do not use on sloped sites where there is the potential for run-off to sensitive areas. Best results are obtained when Velpar is present in the root zone during active growth of the target vegetation. Symptoms usually appear in herbaceous plants within 2 weeks after application under warm, humid conditions, while 4 to 6 weeks may be required when weather is cool. If rainfall after application is inadequate to activate Velpar in the soil, plants may recover from contact effects and continue to grow until sufficient rainfall moves Velpar into the root zone.   

## How it works   

A systemic herbicide readily absorbed through the roots and foliage and translocated upwards. Inhibits photosynthesis.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall is beneficial for activation of product. Grazing: Do not apply within 30 days of harvest (cutting for hay) or feeding of forage or grazing. Re-cropping: Information enabling specific recommendations for rotational crops and re-cropping intervals is limited. Do not seed any crop following alfalfa that has been treated with Velpar L herbicide until a successful field bioassay shows that the crop in question may be grown safely. A successful field bioassay means growing to maturity a test strip of the crop across the field. Re-entry interval: 48 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Apply with a 1 metre buffer between aquatic habitats and a 5 metre buffer between sensitive terrestrial habitats  and the treated area.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = technical 1,690 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Store in a cool, dry place. Keep away from heat, sparks and open flame.

## Application information   

How to apply: Apply with ground equipment only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “b” on page 15.   

## Application tips   

If agitation is stopped for more than 5 minutes, re-suspend spray solution by full agitation prior to commencing spraying again. Do not spray Viper ADV if temperatures of 5oC or lower are forecasted within 3 days of application. Cold temperatures near freezing will negatively affect herbicide performance, as weeds are not actively growing. Initial transient crop yellowing may be observed after application, but this is outgrown and should not affect yield. Apply Viper ADV when broadleaf weeds are small and actively growing and before weeds reach the maximum size recommended for control. DO NOT apply VIPER ADV Herbicide to field peas that have been subjected to stress from conditions such as hail damage, flooding, drought, hot, humid weather, widely fluctuating temperature conditions, prolonged cold weather or injury from prior herbicide applications, as crop injury may result.   

Failure to include UAN will result in significantly reduced product performance.   

## How it works   

Imazamox is a systemic herbicide absorbed by foliage and roots that disrupts plant metabolism causing growth to stop. Bentazon is a contact herbicide taken up primarily through the leaves and interferes with photosynthesis. Thorough coverage of foliage is important for consistent weed control.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfall within 6 hours of application may reduce activity. Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Grazing: Do not graze treated field pea or cut for feed within 20 days of application. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not apply within 60 days of harvest. Re-cropping (Viper only): The following crops may be grown safely the year following an application: field pea, field corn, canary seed*, Group 2 tolerant canola, non-Group 2 tolerant canola*, lentils, spring wheat, durum wheat*, spring barley, sunflower, tame oats*, flax*, chickpea. The following crop may be grown safely 2 years following an application: mustard* (condiment type only). Winter wheat can be grown 3 months after treatment*. There are insufficient data for other following crops. Conduct a field bioassay (a test strip grown to maturity) the year before growing any crop other than those listed above.   

* If drought conditions are experienced between June 1 and September 1 in the year of application, delay planting of winter wheat, durum wheat, canary seed, tame oats, flax, or canola (non-Clearfield) by an additional year.  If drought is received between June 1 and September 1 in the year of application OR between June 1 and September 1 in the year following application, delay planting of mustard by an additional year. In the grey, black, and dark brown soil zones, drought is defined as less than 125 mm of total precipitation between June 1 and September 1. In the brown soil zone, drought is defined as less than 125 mm of total precipitation between June 1 and September 1,  OR less than 15 mm of precipitation in any month between June 1 and September 1. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Do not apply Viper ADV more than once per year.

1 Voraxor applied at 19.5-29mL/acre provides rapid burndown control of all weeds listed below. 2 Apply Voraxor at a rate of 41.5-57mL/acre for suppression of secondary flushes. 3 Suppression only. 4 All types including Roundup Ready.   

## Registered tank mixes   

Voraxor should be tank mixed with glyphosate at 0.5-1L/acre of 360 g/L equivalent. Voraxor may be applied as a pre-seed or pre-emergent treatment to lentils, dry field peas, field corn and soybeans in tank mix combination with Zidua SC or Zidua SC and glyphosate.   

## Application information   

How to Apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water Volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

Add products to the spray tank in the following order: Voraxor, Glyphosate, Merge.   

## Application tips   

Use higher water volumes for dense weed infestations and thick canopies. Do not apply during periods of dead calm or when winds are gusty. Avoid when ready rain if forecast.   

## How it works   

Voraxor is rapidly absorbed by root and foliar uptake. Voraxor is a potent inhibitor of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO). Cell membrane damage induced by inhibition of PPO leads to plant death.

## Expected results   

Susceptible weeds will develop injury symptoms shortly after application, then death of the weeds will be 3 - 5 days after application depending on growing conditions. Susceptible emerging weed seedlings will usually die as they reach the soil surface or shortly after emergence.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Follow the glyphosate manufacturers recommendation for rain fastness. Rainfall shortly after product application can result in slight injury to the crop. Lentils will be more susceptible to injury on coarse textured (sandy or gravely) and low organic matter soils. Injury will appear usually as burning on the outer edges of the leaves. Lentils will grow out of injury symptoms, and yield will not be impacted at recommended rates under normal growing conditions   

Grazing: Field corn forage and silage can be harvested, used as feed or grazed 60 days or more days after application. Legume forage (field peas and lentils) may be used as feed or grazed 60 or more days after application. Wheat and barley forage and hay may be used as feed or grazed 30 or more days after application. Soybeans may be used as feed or grazed 60 days or more days after application. Re-cropping: Winter wheat1 – 3 months after application. Plant back crops barley, dry field pes, lentil, field corn, soybean, wheat (spring, winter, durum).2 Following a spring application of Voraxor – barley, canola, dry field pea, flax, field corn, lentil, mustard, soybean, wheat (spring, durum). Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

1 Follow spring application of Voraxor. 2 To be planted in the same season in case of crop failure. Rate restrictions apply. Lentils, field corn and soybeans can only be grown as plant back crops provided that a maximum product rate of 19.5mL/ac for lentils and 40.5mL/ac for field corn and soybeans was applied in the previous crop. a second application of Voraxor cannot be made in the rescue crop. Crops can also be planted in the next season following chemfallow treatment applied after August 1.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zones specified on label. To reduce runoff from treated areas into aquatic habitats, avoid application to areas with a moderate to steep slope, compacted soil, or clay.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral toxicity (rats): LD50   

> 2,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Requires heated storage. Store in original container in a cool, secure and well-ventilated area.

## Registered tank mixes   

Voraxor Complete must be tank mixed with glyphosate 0.5 - 1 L/acre of 360 g/L equivalent. Merge (200-400 mL/acre) is always required regardless of glyphosate formulation used.   

## Application information   

How to Apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water Volume: 20 - 40 L/acre.   

Use higher water volumes for dense weed stands, larger weeds or when targeting glyphosate resistant populations (i.e., kochia).   

## Mixing instructions   

Do not over agitate at any point in the process. Add products to the spray tank in the following order: Zidua SC –Voraxor – glyphosate – Merge adjuvant. If foaming occurs, add an anti-foaming agent.   

## Application tips   

Good growing conditions promote weed growth and enhance the activity of Voraxor Complete. Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be controlled. Insufficient water volumes or coarse sprays may also reduce control levels. Do not use on peat or muck soils with 7% or more organic matter content.   

## How it works   

Voraxor inhibits protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO). Cell membrane damage induced by inhibition of PPO leads to plant death. Susceptible weeds develop injury symptoms within hours of application under active growing conditions; plant death occurs within 3 to 5 days depending on growing conditions. Zidua SC controls weeds by inhibiting the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids, which halts growth at the apical meristem and coleoptile by reducing cell division and expansion.   

## Expected results   

Weeds affected by Zidua SC may not emerge, or may emerge with irregular leaf margins and reduced growth.

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Follow the glyphosate manufacturer’s recommendation for rainfast. Grazing: Do not graze or cut for feed within 60 days of application. Re-cropping: In the event of crop failure, only labelled crops may be seeded on fields treated with Voraxor Complete (rate restrictions apply). Winter wheat may be seeded 3 months following application. Barley, canola, dry common beans, peas (dried field), flax, field corn, lentils, mustard, soybean, wheat (spring, durum) may be seeded the year following application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

Notes: Weeds will be more easily controlled and early crop competition avoided with applications made when the weeds are small. Control of annual weeds greater than 25 cm in height will be inconsistent, although some weeds may be controlled. Weeds should be actively growing at application.   

## Registered tank mixes   

Glyphosate (Roundup brands) with Roundup WeatherMAX with Transorb 2 Technology. Numerous herbicides tank mixes depending on crop; refer to label.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre.   

## Mixing instructions   

A quality nonionic surfactant (NIS) of at least 70% active may be added to the spray solution at 0.25 % v/v. Read and carefully observe all caution statements and other information on the surfactant label.   

## Application tips   

Use only spray nozzles that produce extremely coarse to ultra coarse spray qualities and minimal amounts of fine spray droplets. Use at least 30 psi (200 kPa) to ensure proper pattern overlap. Do not apply during a temperature inversion as drift potential is high. Apply when air temperature is between 10 and 25°C. Do not spray when the temperature is expected to exceed 30°C or when there is a risk of severe fall in night temperature after use.

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rain within 4 hours of application may reduce control Grazing: Following treatment with XtendiMax® 2 with VaporGrip® Technology or XtendiMax® 2 with VaporGrip® Technology plus 2,4-D, follow these grazing restrictions:   

Do not permit lactating dairy animals to graze fields within 7 days after application. Do not harvest forage or cut hay within 30 days after application. Withdraw meat animals from treated fields at least 3 days before slaughter.   

Re-cropping: A plant-back interval of 120 days is required for those crops not on the label of Roundup Xtend with VaporGrip Technology. Do not count days when the ground is frozen. Moisture is essential for the degradation of this herbicide in soil. If dry weather persists after application, crop injury may occur the following spring.   

Pre-harvest intervals: 86 days for soybean seed, 7 days for soybean forage and 14 days for soybean hay.   

## Re-entry interval: 12 hours   

## Environmental precautions   

Refer to label for information on recommended buffer zones. Be aware of site considerations that may lead to runoff. Using a grassed buffer between treated area and sensitive environments is recommended. Leaching can occur in coarse soil or where water table is shallow.

*Seeds must be planted a minimum of 4 cm deep. **Do not apply to soils classified as sand.   

## Weeds, rates and staging   

Stage – Zidua must be applied before weeds emerge.   

Weeds controlled at a rate of 101 - 200 mL/acre: Barnyard grass, crabgrass (large), foxtail (green, yellow, giant), ryegrass, common water hemp and redroot pigweed. Weeds suppressed (early season residual suppression) at  49 - 97 mL/acre: Foxtail (green and yellow), wild oats, common water hemp, kochia, lamb’s-quarter and redroot pigweed.   

## Registered tank mixes   

## Chickpeas, field peas and lentils: Glyphosate1,2, Heat® LQ3   

Corn: Aatrex® Liquid 480, Armezon®, glyphosate1, Heat LQ3   

Soybeans: Engenia®, glyphosate1, Heat LQ3   

Sunflowers: Glyphosate1   

Potatoes: Glyphosate1, Sencor® 480 F   

## Post-harvest application: Engenia, glyphosate1   

1 Glyphosate present as isopropylamine salt, di-ammonium salt or potassium salt. 2 Can be applied in fall to lentils. 3 Pre-seed or pre-emergence only.   

## Application information   

How to Apply: Ground application only, do not apply by air. Water Volume: 20 - 40L/acre.   

Do not use on peat or muck soils and soils with 7% or more organic matter content.   

## Mixing instructions   

Do not over agitate at any point in the mixing process.   

## Application tips   

Zidua SC must be applied before weeds emerge. Moisture is necessary to activate the active ingredient in the soil for proper control. Dry weather following applications may reduce effectiveness. Zidua SC may not control weeds that germinate after application but before an activating rainfall/irrigation, or weeds that germinate through cracks resulting from dry soil. When adequate moisture is not received after application, weed control may be improved by irrigation.   

## How it works   

Zidua SC is a group 15 herbicide and controls weeds by inhibiting the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids, which halts growth at the apical meristem and coleoptile by reducing cell division and expansion.   

## Expected results   

Weeds affected do not emerge or may emerge with irregular leaf margins and reduced growth.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: ½ - ¾ inch of rain required for activation. Grazing: Do not feed or graze treated hay or forage to livestock.   

Re-cropping: In the event of crop failure, only labeled crops may be seeded on fields treated with Zidua SC (some restrictions apply). All other crops may be seeded 1 year after treatment. Winter wheat may be seeded 4 months following an application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Chemical insect control in Alberta   

The degree of infestation and severity of insect damage varies drastically from area to area and season to season. Most pests, such as grasshoppers, cutworms and Bertha armyworms, require control during periods of abundance that may last from  1 to several years. Other pests, like flea beetles, require control annually in some parts of Alberta.   

## Insect pest monitoring   

The Alberta Insect Pest Monitoring Network can provide more information on insect pests of Alberta. See the web page at agriculture.alberta.ca/bugs-pest   

## Chemical control   

A number of factors should be considered once  the decision to apply an insecticide has been made. Insecticides will kill the pest insect if applied properly at a stage when the pest is susceptible. An application made too early or too late in the life cycle may not provide adequate control. Other factors to consider include: ability of the insecticide to penetrate through the plant foliage, weather conditions, age and size  of the insect, wait period to grazing or harvest and dosage required. If insects are moving into crops  or emerging over an extended period, several applications in the same season may be necessary since most insecticides have limited residual properties when applied to foliage.   

## Safety   

In general, insecticides are more toxic to humans, wildlife, fish, bees and other  non-target organisms than herbicides or fungicides. Follow label directions for safety precautions associated with application of each insecticide. Refer to the introductory section of this book for general information on safety precautions associated with pesticide use.   

## Bee safety   

The insecticides used to protect crops from damaging outbreaks of insect pests can also kill beneficial insects. The objective of the insecticide application is to remove the problem insects from the crop with the least possible impact to beneficial insects such as honeybees and leafcutter bees. Because bees play a critical role in pollinating certain crops, it is important to ensure that an insecticide application has a   

minimum impact on population numbers. Although it may not be possible to totally eliminate the effect of insecticides on beneficial insects, the impact can be greatly reduced when the farmer, pesticide applicator and beekeeper work together.   

Beekeepers should• Talk with the landowners near their bee yards before spray season and provide the farmers with their phone number.   

• Ask farmers if spraying to control insects is  likely this year.   

• Ask the farmer to provide them with notification 48 hours in advance of applying an insecticide.   

Farmers and applicators should• Check for potential insect infestations in field crops early and frequently and determine the economic thresholds for problem insects so that a spray program can be planned should it be required.   

• Notify beekeepers of intentions to spray 48 hours in advance of spraying.   

• Avoid application of insecticides to crops in bloom or to fields containing blooming weeds, which  are attractive to foraging bees. Where feasible,  use a preventative program early in the season when insecticides may be as effective and crops  are not blooming.   

• Spray late in the day or early in the morning  when the temperature is below ideal foraging temperatures to reduce direct exposure to bees. Honeybees are most active when the temperature is above 18°C, usually in the heat of the  day. As a general rule, evening applications are  less hazardous than morning applications.   

• Where there is a risk to bees, use an insecticide that has short residual activity to reduce the impact on the bees and to reduce possibilities  of residues occurring in honey and pollen.   

• Learn about pollination requirements of the different crops grown and about honeybees  and leafcutter bees.   

CautionUnusually low temperatures during and immediately following applications cause insecticides to remain toxic to bees for a much longer period than normal. High temperatures will extend the foraging period,  and application time must be adjusted accordingly. Prevent insecticides from drifting into adjacent blooming crops, roadsides and pastures with weeds

in bloom, water used by bees, leafcutter shelters or apiaries by maintaining a reasonable distance from field boundaries and allowing for the potential movement of insecticides by wind. For more information, contact the Alberta Ag-Info Centre  at 310-FARM (3276).   

Rights and good practiceBy law, persons, provided they do not contravene  any land use by-laws, regulations or generally accepted practices, may operate an agricultural operation (including the application of pesticides).  It’s important to follow label directions and good practices regarding protection of pollinator species from insecticide applications.   

Laws generally allow persons to obtain a benefit  on their property, provided that the benefit is not achieved at the expense of adjacent landowners. Ensure that pesticides are used in a manner where drift does not occur.   

Notification ensures that hazards are identified prior  to spraying so that farmers or their custom applicators can adjust application practices to prevent problems and beekeepers can adjust practices to accommodate spraying. Notification does not mean seeking permission to spray. Farmers have the legal right to apply pesticides on their property.   

## Toxicity of insecticides to honeybees   

## Highly toxic   

## Moderately toxic   

## Relatively non-toxic   

Severe losses may be expected if the following materials are used when bees are present at treatment time or within a few days thereafter   

These can be used around bees if dosage, timing and method of application are correct, but do not apply them directly  on bees, in the field or at the colonies

Notification is a two-way street. Both the beekeeper and farmer have to make efforts to protect pollinators.   

Note: In many cases, beekeepers cannot move or cover their bees, especially during honey flow, so timing and accuracy of an insecticide application, plus selection of the safest insecticide where there is risk to bees, are the only ways to safeguard bees.

## Livestock and residues   

The number of days between the application of an insecticide and harvesting, feeding to livestock or grazing is given on the label. These restrictions must be followed to prevent illegal residues in crops and livestock and to eliminate hazards to consumers.   

## The guide   

This guide only includes the major insecticides registered for use on field crops in Alberta. Not all insects controlled are listed for each insecticide.   

## Economic threshold   

Before making a decision to apply an insecticide, farmers need to know if the application would be economically justified. In addition to the expected dollar value of the crop, the farmer needs to determine whether the insects present will cause a yield loss greater in value than the cost of control. The economic thresholds listed below will assist in making this decision.   

Thresholds are given as the number of insects/unit  of measure (such as #/plant or #/m2) or, for insects that are difficult to sample, the amount of damage evident. Chemical controls are generally only warranted when numbers meet or exceed the threshold level. Remember to sample throughout  the field (minimum of 10 samples per 160 acres)  to obtain an average infestation level.

Alfalfa weevil   

Alfalfa hay crops: Thresholds are based on plant height and  number of larvae: < 30 cm - 1 larva per stem; < 40 cm - 2 larvae per stem. 3 larvae per stem requires control regardless of plant height. Alfalfa seed crops: 20 - 30 larvae per 90° sweep or when 35 - 50% of foliage tips show damage.   

Alfalfa hay crops: If feeding damage detected, cutting hay early can be an effective control strategy.   

Grasshoppers   

Alfalfa: See Cereals table.   

Lygus bugs   

For adults and nymph stages 4 and 5: 2 - 3 lygus per 90° sweep.   

Nymph stages 1, 2 and 3 do not  cause economic damage.   

Pea aphid   

Alfalfa: 75 - 100 aphids per plant.Field pea: 2 - 3 aphids per 20 cm stem tip when 50% of plants have developed some young pods.   

Plant bugs   

Alfalfa for seed: 5 nymphs per sweep (any or all species of plant bugs) when alfalfa is in bud or bloom.   

Sweetclover weevil   

Seedling crop (cotyledon stage): 1 weevil per  5 seedlings under slow growing conditions or  1 weevil per 3 seedlings under normal  growing conditions.Newly emerged 2nd-year stand:  9 - 12 weevils per plant.

## Application tips   

Actara 25 WG: Do not exceed a total of 85 g of Actara per acre during each growing season. Allow at least 7 days between applications. Avoid making aerial applications under conditions where uniform coverage cannot be obtained or where excessive spray drift may occur. Avoid spray overlap. Do not apply Actara after pre-bloom (early pink growth stage) or before post-bloom (petal fall growth stage).   

Potato seed piece treatment: Choose the appropriate rate for Actara 240 SC from the chart on the label, based upon the seeding rate. Use high rate for extended residual control. Do not apply more than 24.4 mL product/100 kg seed pieces or 79.7 mL product per acre. Apply only in areas with adequate ventilation or in areas equipped to remove spray mist or dust. Apply Actara 240SC as a water-based slurry utilizing standard slurry seed treatment equipment which provides uniform seed coverage.

## Actara (cont’d)   

## How it works   

Actara is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide. It controls the sucking and chewing insects through contact  and ingestion.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application of Actara when heavy rain is forecast. Pre-harvest intervals: 7 days. Re-entry interval:   

12 hours. Re-cropping: Treated areas may be replanted immediately following harvest or as soon as practical following the last application with any crop listed on this label or to sorghum, wheat, barley and canola. Any cover crop planted for erosion control or soil improvement may be planted as soon as practical following the last application. However, the cover crop may not be grazed or harvested for food or feed. For all other crops, a 120-day plant-back interval must be observed.   

## Environmental precautions   

Actara is highly toxic to certain aquatic organisms. Do not contaminate water with the product or its container. Observe buffer zones specified on the Actara label. Runoff: Do not apply Actara directly to freshwater habitats.  Do not contaminate irrigation or drinking water supplies or aquatic habitats by cleaning of equipment or disposal of wastes. Leaching: Thiamethoxam is moderate to very persistent in soil and is highly mobile. The use of Actara may result in contamination of groundwater particularly in areas where soils are permeable (e.g., sandy soil) and/or where the depth to the water table is shallow.   

## Toxicity   

Oral LD50   

(rats) >5,000 mg/kg. Dermal LD50   

(rabbits) = >2,000 mg/kg. Toxic to bees.   

## Storage   

Store in cool, dry place and prevent cross contamination with other pesticides, fertilizers, food and feed.

## Registered tank mixes   

Admire 240 can be tank mixed with Ridomil Gold 480 for suppression of pink rot (Phytophthora erythroseptica). Please refer to Ridomil Gold 480 label for use instructions and precautions.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air.   

Water volume: Water volume should be adequate to provide sufficient coverage.   

## Application tips   

Soil application: Apply Admire 240 as a narrow band in-furrow. For best results, direct spray on the seed pieces  or seed potato in the furrow. Foliar application: Apply product as pest numbers begin to increase but before a damaging population becomes established. Scout fields and repeat if needed. Do not make a foliar application of imidacloprid following a soil or seed piece treatment application of product in the same crop. Potato seed piece treatment: Do not dilute with any more than 3 parts water to 1 part insecticide. Agitate or stir spray solution as needed. The higher rate is recommended when extended length of control is needed. Do not apply more than  0.47 L/acre per year. Check the label to select an effective treatment rate based upon seeding rate and desired duration of control.   

## How it works   

Imidacloprid is a systemic chloronicotinyl insecticide.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply product or plant treated seed pieces when heavy rainfall is forecast for the next 48 hours.   

Grazing: Do not use treated seed pieces for food, feed or fodder. Re-entry interval: 24 hours. Pre-harvest interval:   

7 days after a foliar application. Re-cropping: Plant-back interval for cereal grains (wheat, barley, oats) – minimum of 30 days; pea and bean – minimum of 9 months. Other food and feed crops – 12 months. Green manure and other cover crops not intended for human or animal consumption can be grown without plant-back interval. Do not graze or harvest cover crops for food or feed.   

## Environmental precautions   

Imidacloprid is toxic to aquatic invertebrates and birds. Keep out of lakes, streams, ponds or other aquatic systems. Imidacloprid is toxic to bees.   

Runoff: Do not apply to terrain where there is a potential for surface runoff to enter aquatic systems. Leaching:   

Imidacloprid demonstrates the properties and characteristics associated with chemicals detected in groundwater.  The use of Admire 240 in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow, may result  in groundwater contamination.

## How it works   

Flonicamid insecticide is a member of the pyridinecarboxamide class of chemistry. It specifically targets piercing  and sucking pests. Both immature and adult stages begin to stop feeding within 30 minutes of application. The chemical works by contact or ingestion and disrupts the insect’s nervous system, which leads to an inability to feed.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Pre-harvest intervals: Potato, non-grass animal feeds –  7 days. For alfalfa grown for seed, do not use seed or treated forage for human or animal consumption.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Re-cropping: There are no plant-back restrictions for crops listed on the label. All other crops may be planted  30 days after the last application.   

## Environmental precautions   

Flonicamid is toxic to certain beneficial insects. Minimize spray drift to reduce harmful effects on beneficial  insects in habitats next to the application site such as hedgerows and woodland.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 40 L/acre. Aerial – 20 L/acre.   

## How it works   

Coragen/Coragen MaX moves into leaf tissue where it is available to chewing insects feeding on the leaf surface. Feeding on leaf tissues results in paralysis and death. Although feeding quickly comes to a stop, complete insect death may take several days after ingestion.   

## Application tips   

Coverage is important to obtain optimum control. Refer to label for upper limits of Coragen/Coragen MaX allowed per crop group.   

## Restrictions   

Do not make a foliar application of Coragen/Coragen MaX for a minimum of 60 days following an in-furrow or soil application of seed or seed pieces treated with a Group 28 insecticide. Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Pre-harvest intervals: Potato, field pea, lentil, bean, chickpea, oilseed crops, cereals, sugar beet – 1 day. Corn — 1 day for seed and sweet corn. 14 days for field corn and popcorn. Grass forage, alfalfa, clover – zero days.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Re-cropping: There are no rotational crop plant restrictions for this product.   

## Environmental precautions   

Coragen/Coragen MaX is toxic to aquatic organisms. Do not apply this product directly to freshwater habitats. Refer to label for information on buffer zones. Do not contaminate irrigation or drinking water supplies or aquatic habitats by cleaning of equipment or disposal of wastes. Runoff: To reduce runoff from treated areas into aquatic habitats, avoid application to areas with a moderate to steep slope, compacted soil or clay. Leaching: The use of this product may result in contamination of groundwater, particularly in areas where soil is permeable (e.g., sandy soil) and/or the  depth to the water table is shallow.   

## Toxicity

303 - 364 mL   

Apply prior to bloom up to the time when 50% of seedpods are ripe. Begin when adults and/or 4th to 5th instar nymphs have reached economic threshold levels.   

## Registered tank mixes   

None registered.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: Ground – 80  L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Adequate spray coverage is essential to obtain optimum control. Use the higher rate for heavy infestations or dense foliage.   

## How it works   

Targets eggs and immature insect stages. Immature stages are unable to molt and as a result cannot develop into mature adults. Nictonic receptor modulator affects sucking pests systemically, which prevents them from being able to feed.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply when heavy rain is forecast. Pre-harvest intervals: Potato – 7 days; corn – 10 days; alfalfa – 14 days. Grazing: Alfalfa – do not graze treated fields. Re-entry interval: Potato, corn, alfalfa – 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not apply this product directly to freshwater habitats. Toxic to aquatic organisms and to non-target terrestrial plants. Observe buffer zones. Toxic to bees and certain beneficial insects. To reduce runoff from treated areas into aquatic habitats, avoid application to areas with moderate to steep slope, compacted soil or clay.   

## Toxicity   

Acute oral LD50   

(rats) = 146 mg/kg. Dermal LD50

## Registered tank mixes   

Lorsban NT, Sharphos and Pyrinex may be tank mixed with 2,4-D amine and ester, Avenge, Banvel II + 2,4-D amine, Buctril M, MCPA amine and ester. Warhawk, Nufos may be tank mixed with Avenge, Banvel II,  2,4-D amine and ester, MCPA amine and ester, Buctril M.   

Caution: When tank mixing, always add the herbicide to the spray tank first and then add the chlorpyrifos insecticide.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application (unless otherwise specified on the label).   

Water volume: Ground – 20 - 80 L/acre. Aerial – 4 - 12 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

Uniform coverage of crop is essential: use a boom configuration that provides optimum coverage. Use higher rates when infestations are heavy and when foliage is dense.   

Bertha armyworm, and armyworm: Use higher rate for large larvae and when canopy is dense.   

Cutworms: Higher rates and water volumes when the top 1 cm of soil surface is extremely dry or when the infestation is heavy.   

Foliage treatments: When spraying crops near maturity, an application system that gives maximum penetration of the crop canopy is necessary to get good insect kill. Do not apply to crops in bloom. Best results will be obtained when application is made during early evening. Avoid application under hot temperatures. Do not apply to plants under extreme drought stress.   

## How it works   

Chlorpyrifos is a broad-spectrum, non-systemic and contact organophosphate insecticide and acaricide.   

## Expected results   

Insects must come in direct contact with the insecticide to be affected. Degrades on foliage by weathering, and a significant kill of insects eating treated foliage may not last beyond 48 hours after treatment. Somewhat more persistent in soil; control of soil-dwelling insects may be more durable.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Foliar treatments: should be made 4 - 6 hours before forecast rainfall. Soil treatment: Should not be applied if heavy rainfall is forecast. Grazing: Cereals grown for cover crop treated with chlorpyrifos insecticide should not be harvested for human or animal consumption if treated within 60 days of harvest. Pre-harvest interval (days): Barley, oats, wheat (60), canola (21), corn – field and sweet only (70), flax (21), lentil (21 days for applications up to 354 mL/acre, 60 daysdays for applications greater than 354 mL/acre), potato (7), sugar beet (90), sunflowers (42). Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Re-cropping: No information is specified on the label. Maximum allowable applications: Barley, oats, wheat, canola, corn, flax, lentil, sunflower, potato – do not apply more than once per season. See label for restrictions on other crops.   

## Environmental precautions   

Chlorpyrifos is toxic to birds and wildlife and extremely toxic to fish and aquatic organisms. Do not apply directly to water. Drift and runoff from treated areas may be hazardous to aquatic organisms in adjacent aquatic sites.   

Runoff: To reduce runoff from treated areas into aquatic habitats, consider the characteristics and conditions of  the site before treatment. Leaching: Binds to organic matter in soil. As a result it is less likely to leach in soils  with adequate organic matter levels.   

## Toxicity   

Oral LD50   

(rats) formulation = 200 - 776 mg/kg. Toxic to bees.   

## Storage   

Keep away from heat, sparks and open flame. Do not store above 38   

°   

C for extended periods of time. Keep away  from food, drinks and animal feed.

Note: The Canadian Grain Commission does not recommend the use of grain protectants. Malathion is more effective in dry grain than in tough or damp grain because the pesticide breaks down rapidly.   

## Application information   

Foliar treatments: (Malathion 500, 85 E and Malathion 95 ULV) – ground and aerial application. See product label for restrictions. Water volume: Ground – 400 L/acre. Aerial – 12 L/acre minimum.   

Stored grain treatments: Apply with sprayer or dust applicators. Water volume: 10 - 20 L water – Indian meal moth (surface treatment) – 295 mL in 5 - 10 L water/100 m2. Incorporation: Add to grain as it is being augered, or scatter proper amount of dust on each load and cut in with shovel before dumping.   

## Application tips   

All crops: Apply when day temperature is expected to exceed 20°C. Do not apply to plants in bloom. Stored grain:   

To protect from Indian meal moth, spray evenly over the surface of uninfested grain and rake to a depth of 15 cm. Where special application equipment is not available, any type of low pressure sprayer holding 5 L or more can be used. Apply spray to the grain stream as it is being elevated into storage.   

Before storing new grain: Thoroughly clean up old grain and debris from bins, elevators or grain handling equipment. Remove and burn all sweepings. After cleaning the premises, apply a residual malathion spray to walls, floors and machinery in grain elevators or farm storage. Force spray into cracks and crevices. Apply 5 L of spray/100 m2 of surface area using a coarse wetting spray. Wait until spray has thoroughly dried before storing grain in treated areas. Spray this mixture around the outside of bins and elevators to help prevent the insects from entering the bins.   

## How it works   

A non-systemic, contact, organophosphate insecticide and acaricide of brief to moderate persistence. Generally non-phytotoxic.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Grazing: Do not apply to fields occupied by dairy animals, but may be grazed or harvested on the day of application. Pre-harvest intervals: Lentil – 14 days. Canary grass (seed production) – 14 days. All other field crops and pasture – 7 days.

Note: suggested exposures should be observed. A shortened exposure period cannot be compensated for by increased dosage.   

## Application tips   

General: This product is for retail sale to and use only by individuals holding an Alberta Fumigation Pesticide Applicator Certificate or a Farmer Pesticide Certificate with the Fumigation Endorsement. Read the entire label, applicator’s manual and guidance for preparation of a fumigation management plan before use. This product can only be used with a detailed fumigation management plan. The plan must be written for all fumigations prior to treatment.   

Fumigating grain storage units: Make sure the structure is tight enough to retain the fumigant. Seal the structure as necessary. Tablets may be probed into grain or fed into the grain stream as the grain is transferred from 1 bin to another. A minimum buffer zone of 30 metres in all directions from the fumigation site must be established. Placarding is required for both the fumigated site and the buffer zone perimeter. The buffer zone must not include within it any structures unless they are unoccupied during the application. Entry into these structures or the buffer zone must be restricted and is not permitted until the fumigated site has been aerated and the hydrogen phosphide level is at or below 0.1 ppm in the fumigated site and the buffer zone. After application, all openings should be sealed and entries locked and placarded. After the exposure period, open doors and windows for aeration. Fumigated commodities must be aerated for 48 hours prior to selling. Remove all warning placards when aeration is complete.   

## How it works   

Phosphine (hydrogen phosphide) is a colourless gas with a carbide-like odour and high volatility. Formulated product consists of aluminium phosphide, ammonium bicarbonate, urea and paraffin. Upon exposure to air, the ammonium bicarbonate breaks down to form ammonia (a pungent, warning gas) and carbon dioxide (a fire suppressant).  Within 1 - 4 hours hours, depending on temperature and humidity, the product begins to decompose and release phosphine.

back to Table of Contents   

After decomposition, there remains a grey-white dust composed almost entirely of non-poisonous aluminum hydroxide with trace amounts of undecomposed aluminum phosphide. The dust is eliminated when raw agricultural commodities are moved.   

## Expected results   

The effectiveness of this product depends on the fumigation achieved by the release of phosphine gas. Therefore, tightness of the area to be fumigated and temperature of the commodity are essential when determining dosage rates and exposure rates. The tighter the bin and the warmer the temperature of the commodity, the lower the dosage required and vice versa.   

## Restrictions   

Aerate finished food for 48 hours before it is offered to the consumer.   

## Toxicity   

Hydrogen phosphide gas is very toxic to all forms of animal life, and exposure to even small amounts should be prevented. Poisoning results from ingestion or inhalation as hydrogen phosphide is not absorbed through the skin.  It is also insoluble in water, fats and oils.   

## Precautions   

## Protective equipment   

A self-contained breathing apparatus must be worn during delivery/dispensing of products/attending leaks or spills/ de-activation of granules and while monitoring hydrogen phosphide levels during fumigation and aeration periods (i.e., worn at all times when the hydrogen phosphide levels are above 0.1 ppm or unknown).   

## Reduce gas hazards   

Never   

let tablets come in direct contact with liquid. This contact causes the immediate release of hydrogen phosphide.   

Never   

open a container except for immediate usage.   

Never   

confine the product in small gas proof enclosures such as plastic bags. Such confinement could cause the gas concentration to reach the lower flammability level. Take precautions in areas where copper, brass or gold are present, as corrosion may occur.   

Never   

fumigate in areas containing electronic or telephone equipment, photographic film or copy paper. Remove such items or protect them from exposure to the gas. Hydrogen phosphide has great penetrating power, and gas may slowly seep through concrete block walls. Hydrogen phosphide does not layer, but expands to fill the available space.   

## Symptoms of poisoning   

Severity depends on concentration of hydrogen phosphide involved.   

Mild poisoning   

results in fatigue, nausea, pressure or pain in the chest, ringing in the ears and uneasiness. Hydrogen phosphide is not a chronic poison, and these symptoms will readily disappear with rest and fresh air.   

Greater quantities of gas   

produce such symptoms as vomiting, stomach ache, diarrhea, disturbance in equilibrium and dyspnea (difficulty in breathing). Very high concentrations quickly cause bluish-purple skin colour, agitation, poor muscle co-ordination, sub-normal blood oxygen content, unconsciousness and death. Death can occur very quickly or be delayed several days as a result  of pulmonary edema and collapse, by paralysis of the central respiratory system. In cases of severe poisoning, disturbance in liver and kidney function can also occur.   

## First aid   

Should exposure to hydrogen phosphide be documented or suspected, remove patient from gas atmosphere to open air.   

Call a physician immediately   

. Have the patient lie down, keeping him warm and comfortable. Treat as for shock. Make   

no   

antidotal use of fats, oil, butter or milk. Do   

not   

administer atropine as it is contraindicative. Begin artificial respiration if breathing has ceased. When exposure to low concentrations of hydrogen phosphide has been documented or suspected, the individual involved should rest for 24 hours, and under no circumstances should he resume any work dealing with fumigation. If ingested, induce vomiting by touching the back of the throat with a blunt object.   

## Storage   

Tablets are received in resealable flasks. As long as flasks remain intact, the storage life of the product is unlimited. Storage should be in a dry, locked, ventilated area and out of the reach of children and irresponsible persons.

## Application tips   

Apply recommended dosage by conventional ground sprayer equipment capable of delivering sufficient water to obtain thorough, uniform coverage of the target crop. Spray equipment boom and nozzles should be oriented in a manner to minimize boom height to optimize coverage uniformity, maximize deposition and reduce spray drift.  Drop nozzles may be required to obtain uniform coverage against certain pests that develop down in the canopy. Higher water volume will provide better coverage and performance.   

## How it works   

Rimon insecticide is an insect growth regulator that must be absorbed by eggs or ingested by insect larvae to be  fully effective. The primary mode of action is by disrupting cuticle formation and deposition occurring when insects change from 1 developmental stage to another, resulting in death at molting. Due to this mode of action, Rimon does not have any effect on adult stages of insects that have completed larval development.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Pre-harvest interval: 14 days. Grazing: Do not allow livestock to graze treated fields. Do not use treated crops for livestock feed.   

## Environmental precautions   

May be toxic to bee colonies exposed to direct treatment, drift or residues on flowering crops or weeds. Avoid applying this product to flowering crops or weeds if bees are visiting the treatment area. Toxic to aquatic organisms. Avoid application of this product when heavy rainfall is forecast. Do not apply directly to water or to areas where surface water is present. Rimon insecticide is toxic to immature insects. Minimize spray drift in habitats next to the application site to reduce harmful effects on beneficial insects.

Rainfall: Rain within 1 hour may reduce control. Pre-harvest intervals: Grass and nongrass forage crops – zero days. Potato, soybean, sorghum – 7 days. Re-cropping: A 30-day plant-back interval is required for crops not listed on the label. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms. Observe buffer zones and vegetative filter strips specified in the product label. To reduce runoff from treated areas into aquatic habitats avoid application to areas with a moderate to steep slope, compacted soil, or clay. Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Bees:   

Application during the crop blooming period, and when flowering weeds are present, may be made in the evening when most bees are not foraging. Minimize spray drift to reduce exposure to bees in habitats close to the application site.   

## Toxicity

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 12 L/acre minimum. Aerial – for specific crops only, 4 L/acre minimum. See label for details.   

## Application tips   

Timing and good coverage are essential for effective control. Sevin XLR applications are more resistant to wash-off when applied as a concentrated suspension. To ensure wash-off resistance, apply dilutions 1 part Sevin XLR to no greater than 39 parts water. Application should be made to dry foilage to maximize wash-off resistance.   

## How it works   

A carbamate insecticide that works by contact and ingestion. Moderate to rapid in speed of action with moderate to long residual effectiveness (2 days to 4 weeks) depending on crop/pest complex, formulation and climatic conditions. Some immediate control is expected, but the majority of control occurs 24 to 48 hours after application.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Do not apply just before rain. Avoid application of this product when heavy rain is forecast. Grazing:   

Forage and feed crops, including bean vines, hay, pea vines, may be grazed or harvested for use as feed for dairy animals 48 hours after treatment and meat animals 24 hours after treatment without resulting in illegal residues in milk or meat. Remove cattle from area to be sprayed. Treated forage and feed crops may be fed to dairy animals and animals for slaughter provided sprays are applied as directed. Beef cattle may be re-introduced to range 1 day after application; dairy cattle 2 days after application.   

## Pre-harvest intervals   

(days): Pea (3), bean (5), potato (7). Forage grasses, non crop areas, pasture, rangeland – beef cattle 1 day, dairy cattle 2 days.

## Environmental precautions:   

Toxic to birds, mammals and aquatic organisms. Observe buffer zones specified on the label. To reduce runoff from treated areas avoid application to areas with moderate to steep slope, bare soil and poorly draining soil.  Contamination of aquatic areas as a result of runoff may be reduced by including a vegetative strip between the treated area and the edge of the water body. Toxic to bees. Bees may be exposed through direct spray, spray drift and residues on leaves, pollen and nectar in flowering crops and weeds. Minimize spray drift to reduce harmful effects on bees. Avoid applications when bees are foraging in the treatment area in ground cover containing blooming weeds.   

Drift: Do not apply or allow to drift to blooming crops or weeds if bees are visiting the treatment area.

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms. Treated seed is toxic to birds and small wild mammals. Any spilled or exposed seeds pieces must be incorporated into the soil or otherwise cleaned-up from the soil surface. The use of this chemical may result in contamination of groundwater, particularly in areas where soils are permeable (e.g., sandy soil) and/or the depth to the water table is shallow. Toxic to bees.

## Potato   

Colorado potato beetle, European corn borer, flea beetles, aphids (suppression)   

60 mL   

Begin applications when treatment thresholds have been reached. Apply as a directed foliar spray ensuring thorough coverage. Maximum of 2 applications per season. Minimum interval between applications (ground or aerial) is 10 days. Maximum vayego allowed per crop season: 120 mL/ac.   

## Corn   

European corn borer, corn earworm, cutworms, armyworms, flea beetlesSuppression of aphids   

60 mL   

Begin applications when treatment thresholds have been reached. For control of European corn borer and corn earworm, time the application with peak egg hatch.   

## Soybean   

Cutworms, armyworms   

60 mL   

Begin applications when treatment thresholds have been reached.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 40 L/acre minimum.  Aerial (potato only) – 20 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

Do not apply during crop blooming stage. Where possible, rotate the use of vayego insecticide or other Group 28 insecticides with different groups that control the same pests.   

## How it works   

Tetraniliprole disrupts muscle activity in the insects, resulting in paralysis. Treated pests stop feeding quickly after ingestion, become lethargic and lose mobility.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast 1 hour after application. Pre-harvest intervals: Potatoes – 14 days. Field corn – 14 days. Sweet corn – 1 day. Soybean – 14 days. Plant-back interval: All labelled crops may be planted back immediately following application. Observe a 30-day plant-back interval for root vegetables, leaves of root and tuber vegetables, bulb vegetables, legumes, cucurbits, cereal grains for grain, forage, fodder or straw, rapeseeds, sunflowers and alfalfa. Observe a 120-day plant-back interval for all other crops.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to bees. Do not apply this product or allow drift to blooming crops or weeds. Toxic to aquatic organisms. Observe buffer zones specified on the label. Toxic to certain beneficial insects. Minimize spray drift to reduce harmful effects on beneficial insects in habitats next to the application site such as hedgerows and woodland. Tetraniliprole is persistent in soils and aquatic systems. This product demonstrates the properties and characteristics associated with chemicals detected in groundwater. The use of tetraniliprole in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow, may result in groundwater contamination. Contamination of aquatic areas as a result of runoff may be reduced by including a vegetative strip between the treated area and the edge of the water body.   

## Toxicity   

Oral LD50 (rats) = > 2,000 mg/kg. Dermal LD50 (rats) = > 2,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

To prevent contamination, store this product away from food or feed.

## Potato   

Colorado potato beetle, potato flea beetle (early season control of spring adults)   

6.75 to 9 mL per 100 metre of row  OR  304 to 405 mL per acre  (based on 90 cm row spacing)   

In-furrow application: Apply as a narrow band in-furrow. For best results, direct spray on the seed pieces in the furrow. Thorough coverage of seed pieces is important to obtain optimum control.   

## Registered tank mixes   

None registered.   

## Application information   

Mix with water for application as in-furrow spray or seed-piece treatment with appropriate equipment. Always add Verimark to water; never put Verimark into a dry tank or other mixing equipment without first adding water. Mix thoroughly; once dispersed, continued agitation is required. Spray mix should not be stored overnight in the spray tank.   

## Application tips   

When pest populations are expected to be high, use the highest listed application rate for that pest. Coverage is important to obtain optimum control. Do not make more than 1 soil application per season.  Do not exceed a total of 0.607 L/acre per season.   

## How it works   

After exposure to Verimark, affected insects will rapidly stop feeding, become paralyzed and typically die  within 1 - 3 days.

## Restrictions   

Do not make a subsequent foliar application of any Group 28 insecticide for a minimum of 60 days following an in-furrow application or planting of seed pieces treated with Verimark insecticide. Colorado potato beetle resistance management: Do not apply any Group 28 insecticide for Colorado Potato Beetle control if Verimark was used  at planting as in-furrow. Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Pre-harvest interval: 21 days.   

Re-cropping: Plant-back Intervals (PBI) for rotational crops range from zero to 365 days.  See the label for information on PBI for specific crops. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Verimark is toxic to aquatic organisms. Do not contaminate irrigation or drinking water supplies or aquatic habitats by the cleaning of equipment or disposal of wastes. Toxic to bees. This product is systemic, and bees can be exposed to product residues in flower, leaves, pollen and/or nectar resulting from soil applications. However, when this product is applied and used according to label directions, the risk to bees is expected to be negligible.   

## Toxicity   

Low acute toxicity. Oral LD50   

(rats) = > 5,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Store product in original container only, away from other pesticides, fertilizer, food or feed. Do not let product freeze.

## Seed treatment of cereal, forage, oilseed and pulse crops   

## Purpose of seed treatment   

Seed treatment provides economical insurance against many diseases and some insect pests of seed and seedlings. Chemical treatment can give seedlings a head start by preventing or reducing damage resulting from certain crop pests.   

Diseases are controlled by contact fungicides that destroy fungi carried on the seed, such as common bunt of wheat, the surface-borne smuts of barley  and oats, fungus stripe of barley and some leaf-spotting and seed decay fungi. Systemic fungicides destroy fungi carried in the seed, such as loose smut of wheat and barley, and they protect the early growth of the seedling.   

Specific recommendations:   

• Rye and flax should be treated because they are very susceptible to seed decay.   

• Winter wheat should be treated to prevent bunt and seed decay as well as to promote good seedling growth.   

• If bunt or smut was observed in a crop that will  be used for seed, the grain should be treated. If a variety is grown that is susceptible to bunt or smut and the presence of the disease is uncertain, it may be wise to treat the seed annually or every second year, depending on the susceptibility of the variety.   

• Canola should always be treated to control the seed-borne phase of blackleg.   

• Alfalfa seed is treated to control verticillium wilt.   

Insecticidal seed treatment will prevent or reduce damage caused by certain crop pests.   

## Methods of seed treatment   

Custom treatmentFungicides are applied to the seed sometime before planting. Seed cleaning plants are equipped to treat seed with liquid fungicides. Canola can only be  treated by custom applicators as there are no farmer-applied seed fungicides available. Farmers can use  a variety of methods for both liquid and dry formulation application.   

## Precautions•   

Read and follow label directions carefully.   

•   

Treated seed must not be allowed to contaminate grain intended for food, feed or commercial use.   

•   

Bury leftover treated seed or store it safely in labelled bags for future use as seed.   

•   

Treated seed offered for sale must be labelled  with the name of the treated chemicals (   

Seed Act   

).   

•   

Treated seed in transit must be bagged or bulk loads tarped to prevent spillage.

## Application information   

Apply 100 mL of Apron Advance seed treatment per 100 kg of seed as a water-based slurry utilizing standard slurry seed treatment equipment that provides uniform seed coverage. To achieve an accurate slurry, fill each jug with water and shake well prior to application. Uneven or incomplete seed coverage may not give the desired level of disease control. Thoroughly mix the recommended amount of Apron Advance seed treatment into the required amount of water for the slurry treater and dilution rate to be used. Slurry volumes will vary depending on seed size.   

Seed treatment and inoculants: Apron Advance can be used with most Rhizobium-based inoculants. Contact inoculant manufacturer for proper recommendations. Treated seed may not flow at the same rates through seeding equipment as untreated seed. Mixing with inoculants may increase drying time. With rough-coated seed, the addition of water to Apron Advance will increase coverage; contact Syngenta for more information.

Cruiser 5FS can be tank mixed with Apron Maxx RTA, Dividend XL RTA and Vibrance 500FS. Follow the more stringent precautionary measures for mixing, loading and applying as stated on both product labels.   

## Application information   

Ensure product is thoroughly mixed prior to application. Apply Cruiser 5FS Seed Treatment utilizing closed system seed treatment equipment that provides uniform seed coverage. Thoroughly mix the recommended amount of Cruiser 5FS Seed Treatment into the required amount of water for the slurry rate to be used. Maintain constant agitation of the slurry. Allow the seed to dry before bagging or storing into bulk containers. Depending on planting equipment, seed treated with Cruiser 5FS Seed Treatment may not flow through planting equipment at the same rate as untreated seed. Recalibrate equipment before planting treated seed.   

## How it works   

Cruiser 5FS Seed Treatment belongs to the neonicotinoid class of chemistry that controls listed chewing and sucking insects through contact and systemic activity. When seed is treated for post-planting protection against registered pests, Cruiser 5FS Seed Treatment will also provide protection during post-treatment storage of the seed against damage from many storage insect pests.   

Seed treated with Cruiser 5FS Seed Treatment has been tested and found to be effective against rusty grain beetle, saw-toothed grain beetle, red flour beetle, rice weevil, lesser grain borer, European corn borer and Indian-meal moth.

## Application information   

Store cut seeds between 7°C. and 10°C. Apply only in areas with adequate ventilation or in areas that are equipped to remove mist or dust. Seed loading onto the belt should be uniform. If the treated seed is to be stored for several days, ensure there is adequate cool air movement through the pile of cut seed potato at a relative humidity of 85 to 90%. An inert dust may be used to help suberization. Cut and treated seed should not be piled above 1.8 metres in height. Optimal results are obtained if potatoes are planted immediately after being treated. Do not apply more than 190 mL/acre (rate required for seeding rate of 21 cwt/acre). For seeding rates higher than 21 cwt/acre, use Maxim D plus Actara (consult labels for rates).   

## How to apply   

Apply as a water-based slurry utilizing standard slurry seed treatment equipment that provides uniform seed coverage. Thoroughly mix the recommended amount of Cruiser Maxx Potato Extreme into the required amount of water or tank mix partner for the slurry treater and dilution rate to be used. Maintain constant agitation of the slurry during treatment.   

## How it works   

Cruiser Maxx Potato Extreme is active against black scurf, stem and stolon canker, silver scurf and fludioxonil resistant Fusarium dry rot and contains thiamethoxam, a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide that controls listed sucking and chewing insects through contact and ingestion.

## Application information   

Apply Fortenza as a water-based slurry utilizing standard slurry seed treatment equipment that provides uniform seed coverage. Uneven or incomplete seed coverage may not give the desired level of insect control. This product contains no colourant. An appropriate colourant must be added when this product is applied. Regulations pertaining to the Seeds Act must be strictly adhered to when using this product. Seed must be conspicuously coloured at the time of treatment.   

## Application tips   

Potato: Cut seed is particularly vulnerable to excess moisture. Too much moisture will induce seed decay. Fortenza has been designed to be delivered in very low volumes of liquid to ensure good coverage without increasing tuber decay. Store cut seed at or below 7°C. When treating cut seed, Fortenza can be followed with a dust/talc treatment to improve suberization. Apply only in areas with adequate ventilation or in areas that are equipped to remove mist or dust.

## Application information   

Insure Pulse is a ready-to-use seed treatment formulation for use in commercial seed treatment plants and for use in on-farm standard gravity flow or mist-type treatment machines. Insure Pulse can also be used in “On the Go” air seeder treatment systems. Agitate thoroughly prior to use. When used at the recommended rate of 300 mL/100 kg seed, no additional dyes or dilutions with water are needed unless recommended by the manufacturer of the seed treatment application equipment. If water is added, increase the use rate proportionally to the dilution rate (e.g., add 100 mL of water to 300 mL of Insure Cereal Pulse, then apply 400 mL/100 kg seed). NOTE: If using the 600 mL per 100 kg rate (flax), it is recommended that the seed be treated into a bin or truck box to allow the treated seed to dry prior to placing into the seeder hopper. This will prevent clumping and bridging in the seeder.

## Registered tank mixes   

For control of seed- and soil-borne diseases, Lumivia CPL can be mixed with fungicide seed treatments in compliance with the application recommendations of the product being mixed.   

## Application information   

For use in commercial facilities and on-farm seed treatment equipment. This product contains no colourant. An appropriate colourant must be added when this product is applied. All seed must be conspicuously coloured at time of application. Apply only in areas with adequate ventilation or in areas that are equipped to remove mist or dust.   

## Application tips   

Dilute in a sufficient volume to obtain thorough, uniform coverage. Polymers, colourants, and other additives should be tested for compatibility and seed safety prior to use in combination with Lumivia CPL insecticide seed treatment.   

## How it works   

Chlorantraniliprole is a systemic insecticide seed treatment, which, when ingested, impairs the muscle function of the target pest.   

## Restrictions   

Do not use treated seed for food, feed, or oil processing. Do not make a subsequent foliar application of any Group 28 insecticide for a minimum 60 days after planting seed treated with Lumivia CPL. If a foliar spray is required during this window, it must be made with an insecticide other than Group 28.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to birds. Any spilled or exposed seeds must be incorporated into the soil or otherwise cleaned up from the soil surface. Toxic to aquatic organisms. Do not contaminate irrigation or drinking water supplies or aquatic habitats by cleaning of equipment or disposal of wastes. Leaching: The use of this chemical may result in contamination of groundwater particularly in areas where soils are permeable (e.g., sandy soil) and/or the depth to the water table is shallow. Do not use products containing chlorantraniliprole on areas treated with this product in the previous season.   

## Toxicity

## Application information   

METLOCK CT does not contain a colourant; any seed treated with METLOCK CT must be conspicuously coloured (red). METLOCK CT is a concentrated formulation and should be mixed with water at a ratio of 5 parts water to  1 part METLOCK CT to ensure sufficient seed coverage. More water can be used if necessary. All labelled crops  are registered for commercial application facilities and mobile treaters. Cereal grains (excluding corn) are registered for on-farm use.   

## How it works   

METLOCK CT is a systemic product used to control or suppress listed seed-borne and soil-borne diseases of cereal grains. The fungicide active ingredients in METLOCK CT are metconazole, a broad-spectrum, systemic triazole fungicide and metalaxyl, an oomycete-active, systemic acylalanine fungicide. Metalaxyl interrupts fungal nucleic acid synthesis and metconazole inhibits sterol biosynthesis.   

## Restrictions   

All labelled crops are registered for commercial application facilities and mobile treaters. Cereal grains  (excluding corn) are registered for on-farm use. Do not use treated seed for food, feed or oil processing.   

Grazing: Do not graze or harvest for forage/feed for 4 weeks after planting. Re-cropping: Barley, corn, canola, oats, rye, wheat, soybean and sugar beet may be replanted at any time. A 35-day plant back interval for all other crops applies.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms and non-target terrestrial plants. Do not use in areas where soils are permeable  and where the water table is shallow.

## Application information   

Apply Teraxxa F4 as a water-based mixture using standard slurry or mist-type seed treatment application equipment.  Agitate thoroughly prior to use. When used at the recommended rate of 300 mL/100 kg seed, no additional dyes or dilutions with water are needed unless recommended by the manufacturer of the seed treatment application equipment. If water is added, increase the use rate proportionally to the dilution rate (e.g., add 100 mL of water to 300 mL of Teraxxa F4, then apply 400 mL/100 kg seed).   

Teraxxa F4 can be used in commercial treatment facilities and on-farm standard gravity flow or mist type treatment machines. Teraxxa F4 can also be used in “On the Go” air seeder treatment systems.   

## How it works   

Teraxxa F4 insecticide and fungicide seed treatment is a suspension concentrate that protects against damage caused by wireworm and seed and soil borne diseases. The insecticide component, Broflanilide, is a Group 30 class of chemistry that controls wireworms through contact and ingestion. The fungicide components provide systemic activity on seed-borne and soil-borne diseases. The fungicide components are Pyraclostrobin, Triticonazole, Metalaxyl and Fluxapyroxad. Pyraclostrobin is a strobilurin fungicide that provides systemic broad-spectrum activity against seed- and soil-borne diseases. Triticonazole is a triazole fungicide that provides systemic broad-spectrum protection against seed- and soil-borne diseases. Metalaxyl is a phenylamide fungicide with systemic activity against seed and seedling diseases caused by oomycete fungi. Fluxapyroxad is a carboximide fungicide that provides systemic broad-spectrum protection against seed- and soil-borne diseases.

## Restrictions   

Labelling: Treated seed (bulked or bagged) must be labelled as follows: “Keep out of reach of children and animals. Store away from feed and food stuff. DO NOT use for food, feed or oil processing. This seed is treated with Teraxxa F4 containing broflanilide, pyraclostrobin, fluxapyroxad, triticonazole and metalaxyl.   

Use only closed cab planting equipment when planting seeds treated with Teraxxa F4. During handling and planting treated seeds, wear coveralls over a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, chemical-resistant gloves, socks and shoes. Wear a NIOSH-approved N95 (minimum) filtering facepiece respirator (dust mask) that is properly fit tested when transferring treated seed to the planter/seeder.   

Broflanilide is toxic to bees. Dust generated during planting of treated seed may be harmful to bees and other pollinators. To help minimize the dust generated during planting, refer to the “Pollinator Protection and Responsible Use of Treated Seed- Best Management Practices” on the Health Canada webpage on pollinator protection at   

www.canada.ca/pollinators. Do not load or clean planting equipment near bee colonies, and avoid places where bees may be foraging, such as flowering crops or weeds. When turning on the planter avoid engaging the system where emitted dust may contact honey bee colonies. Spilled or exposed seeds and dust must be incorporated into the soil or cleaned up from the soil surface.”   

Re-cropping: Immediate plant-back is permitted for all labelled crops. A plant-back interval of 30 days is required for all crops not on the label.

Vibrance Quattro is for use on-farm and can also be applied by commercial seed treaters (facilities and mobile treaters) using closed system transfer. Apply Vibrance Quattro utilizing seed treatment equipment that provides uniform seed coverage. Depending on seed size, Vibrance Quattro may be applied as a ready-to-apply application or water may be added to form slurry for more uniform coverage. Allow the seed to dry before bagging or storing into bulk containers. Depending on planting equipment, seed treated with Vibrance Quattro may not flow through planting equipment at the same rate as untreated seed. Recalibrate this equipment before planting treated seed.   

## How it works   

Vibrance Quattro is a combination of the fungicides difenoconazole, metalaxyl-M and S-isomer, sedaxane and fludioxonil, which control or suppress certain seed- and/or soil-borne diseases of cereal crops as listed.   

## Restrictions   

Treated seed must not be used for food, feed or oil processing. Grazing: Do not graze or feed livestock on treated areas for 45 days after planting. Re-cropping: Do not plant any crop other than cereals within 60 days to fields in which seeds treated with Vibrance Quattro were planted.

## Application information   

How to apply: Apply using equipment that ensures uniform and thorough coverage of each seed piece. Cut pieces should be treated immediately after cutting. Treated seed pieces should be planted in soil above 7°C with adequate soil moisture required for planting. If cut seed needs to be stored or held for a few days, make sure that there is adequate cool air (15.5°C) movement through the pile of cut seed potatoes at relative humidity of 1 to 2.  Cut and treated seed should not be piled above 1.8 metres in height.   

## How it works   

Vibrance Ultra Potato is a systemic seed treatment. It is to be used as an integral part of a potato disease  management strategy.   

## Restrictions   

Do not use treated seed pieces for food or feed purposes. Do not apply more than 242 g mandipropamid/acre/year. Refer to the chart on the Revus label on the maximum number of foliar applications allowed following the use of Vibrance Ultra Potato Fungicide as a potato seed piece treatment.   

## Environmental precautions   

Vibrance Ultra Potato is toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. Do not apply directly to water or to areas where surface water is present. Do not contaminate water by cleaning of equipment or disposal of equipment wash waters.

## Application tips   

Treat only clean seed of known quality that is free of debris and dust. Uniform coverage is critical to obtain optimum results; uneven seed coverage may not give the desired level of disease control. Consult manufacturer’s label or recommendations with regard to the use of Vitaflo 280/Vitaflo SP/Loveland Vitaflo and rhizobia inoculants.   

## How it works   

Thiram is a fungicide that controls diseases carried on the seed. Carbathiin is a systemic fungicide that penetrates  the seed coat to control diseases inside the seed and seedling.   

## Restrictions   

Grazing: Do not graze or feed livestock on treated areas for 4 weeks after planting except for the following crops. Soybean – do not graze or feed livestock on forage and hay on treated areas. Dry bean – do not graze or feed on bean forage for 60 days after planting. Barley, oats, wheat – do not graze or feed on treated area for 6 weeks after planting. Do not use treated seed for food, feed or oil processing.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not contaminate ponds, lakes or streams.   

## Toxicity   

Oral LD50   

(rats) = 4,587 mg/kg. Dermal LD50   

(rat) = > 2,000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Do not store Vitaflo 280/Vitaflo SP/Loveland Vitaflo at temperatures above 35°C. These products will not freeze solid even in winter temperatures. If containers have been in storage for several months, some settling may occur and containers may require agitation.

## Application tips   

All labelled crops are registered for commercial application facilities and mobile treaters. For all labelled seeds, commercial seed treatment (facilities and mobile treaters with closed transfer, including closed mixing, loading, calibrating, and closed treatment equipment only) is permitted. All labelled crops for on-farm treatment (open transfer, including open mixing, loading, calibrating and open treatment equipment) is permitted.   

## How it works   

Zeltera Pulse contains the active ingredients ethaboxam, mandestrobin, inpyrfluxam and metalaxyl. Ethaboxam is a Group 22 fungicide; it’s mode of action is the inhibition of cell division. Mandestrobin belongs to the strobilurin or Quinone Outside Inhibitors (QoI) class Group 11 of fungicides. Metalaxyl is a member of the acylalanine chemical Group 4 and interrupts fungal nucleic acid synthesis. Inpyrfluxam belongs to Group 7, the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) group of fungicides and acts by inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the fungal respiration chain.

## Chemical control of plant diseases in Alberta   

## Introduction   

Plants, like other living organisms, are attacked by many diseases that are caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, mycoplasmas and nematodes. The management of plant diseases is based on 4 general parameters:   

•   

## Exclusion   

(quarantine): A disease organism or   

diseased plant material is prevented from entering a country or disease-free area where the disease could become established.   

•   

Protection: Includes management practices   

that can be used to protect plants from disease organisms. Examples include proper sanitation, chemical controls, adequate soil nutrient levels and good soil drainage.   

•   

Eradication: Involves the use of crop rotations  or the application of chemicals such as fungicides to control plant disease.   

•   

Plant breeding: Results in the development of crop plants that have partial or complete resistance to a specific disease or range of infectious diseases.   

## Chemical control of disease   

In Alberta, fungal diseases of some field crops may  be subject to direct chemical control by fungicides.  At present, foliar fungicides are registered for a number of significant foliar diseases including the following: Sclerotinia white mould, alternaria black spot and blackleg control in canola, cereal leaf diseases, foliar diseases of potato and pulse crops.

## How it works   

Aprovia Top fungicide combines difenocazole with solatenol, a new, longer lasting SDHI. Solatenol metabolizes slowly in the plant for long residual protection against target diseases. Both actives have translaminar activity, providing protection inside the plants and on both sides of the leaf.   

## Restrictions   

Potato: Do not make more than 2 applications by air (for a total of 0.78 L/acre/season) OR do not make more than  4 applications by ground (for a total of 1.6 L/acre/season). For potato, if applications are made by 1 method (ground or air), all consecutive applications must be made by the same method. It is not acceptable to mix aerial and ground applications in the same calendar year. Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Pre-harvest interval: Potato – 14 days. Re-cropping: Registered crops – zero days. Do not apply to cereals and corn for 60 days after application. Do not apply to any other crops intended for food or feed for 180 days after application.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms, non-terrestrial plants and certain beneficial insects. Minimize spray drift to reduce harmful effects on beneficial insects in habitats next to the application sites. Benzovindiflupyr and difenoconazole are persistent and may carry over. It is recommended that any products containing these active ingredients not be used in areas treated with this product during the previous season.

## Application tips   

For resistance management, tank mix Cevya with another product with an alternate mode of action that is effective against the target pest.   

## How it works   

Cevya is a DMI or SBI (sterol biosynthesis inhibitor). It is a systemic product and is slow released from inner-leaf reservoirs for consistent protection.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast in 1 hour. Grazing: Treated crops may be grazed 7 days after application. Pre-harvest interval:   

7 days. Re-cropping: All labelled crops may be planted immediately after application. Crops not on the label must not be planted for one month after application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Toxic to aquatic organisms. Observe buffer zones specified on the label. Runoff: To reduce runoff from treated areas avoid application to areas with a moderate to steep slope, compacted soil or clay. It is recommended that Cevya not be used in areas treated with this product the previous season.

## Non-susceptible crop next spring   

0.4 kg   

## MaintenanceAll crops (annual maintenance treatment  after initial application)   

0.2 - 0.8 kg   

After initial application of Contans,  it is recommended to apply a maintenance treatment of 0.2 kg/acre to reduce inoculum levels in the field. Annual maintenance rate will depend on crop type and tillage practices.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: 40 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

Use sufficient water volume to ensure thorough coverage of the soil surface and/or crop residues. After incorporation, treated soils should not be disturbed (e.g., plowed) to avoid bringing untreated sclerotia from lower soil depths to the top soil layer. As part of an overall long term pest management strategy, it is recommended to use other management practices in addition to Contans such as in-crop foliar applications and following proper crop rotations.   

Do not tank mix with fungicides or fertilizers. Do not tank mix with acids, alkalis or any product that attacks organic materials. Contact UAP Canada for more information on products that are compatable with Contans.   

## How it works   

When applied correctly, the active ingredient in Contans WG will destroy Sclerotia in the soil before the Sclerotia are able to produce fruiting bodies. Regular use of Contans in successive years within a long term management strategy will improve disease control.   

## Restrictions   

Pre-harvest intervals: Contans WG can be applied up to and including the day of harvest.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not apply this product directly to freshwater habitats. Do not contaminate irrigation or drinking water supplies  by cleaning of equipment or disposal of wastes.

Good coverage is essential for effective disease control, and higher water volumes tend to increase performance with dense canopies. Cotegra works best when applied in a preventive manner prior to the development of disease.   

## How it works   

The active ingredient boscalid is a SDHI fungicide with systemic activity and best applied as a preventive fungicide. The active ingredient prothioconazole is a triazole fungicide with broad spectrum systemic activity.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Rainfast in 1 hour. Grazing: All crops can be grazed or  fed to livestock 7 days of application. Pre-harvest intervals: Chickpea, dry bean, faba bean, lentil, field pea and soybean – 21 days. Canola and oriental mustard – 36 days. Re-cropping: Labelled crops may be planted 14 days after last application. All crops not on label require 30 days after last application. Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Observe buffer zones specified on the label. Do not apply on any body of water and prevent cleaning of equipment near water bodies. Reduce risk of runoff from treated areas into aquatic habitats by avoiding application to areas  with a moderate to steep slope or compacted soil. Toxic to aquatic organisms.

## Potato   

Late blight (Phytophthora infestans)   

Curzate: 0.09 kg/acrePlusManzate DF  0.55 - 0.65 kg/acre  or Dithane Rainshield   

Initial applications should start when local conditions indicate that late blight is imminent. Make additional applications at 5 - 7 day intervals, however, at least 20 days must pass between a second and third application. Apply no more than 4 applications per crop. Use higher rate of Manzate DF under conditions of high disease pressure. Do not mix and apply more than 38 kg of Curzate Fungicide per day for ground application (enough to treat 420 acres). Do not mix and apply more than 50 kg of Curzate Fungicide per day for aerial application (enough to treat 543 acres).   

## Registered tank mixes   

Manzate 200 DF. Corteva Agriscience supports the use of Dithane Rainshield as a tank mix.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 80 - 400 L/acre. Aerial – 20 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

Caution: Use Curzate only in a tank mix with Manzate DF. Do not use Curzate alone. Do not apply to a potato crop that is suffering from stress as a result of drought, water saturation, low temperatures, insect infestations, nutrient deficiency or any other factors contributing to a reduction in crop growth.   

## How it works   

The active ingredient cymoxanil in Curzate is a highly active, locally systemic fungicide recommended for  the control of late blight on potato. It works as a preventive, curative and inhibitive (against sporulation) product. Curzate offers a unique feature for late blight management called “kick-back” activity. It controls infections that  have already attacked the crop but are not yet visible.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Curzate is rainfast within 2 hours after application. Pre-harvest intervals: Do not harvest within  8 days of treatment. Re-entry interval: 24 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Overspray or drift to sensitive habitats must be avoided. For tank mixes, consult the labels of the tank mix partners and observe the largest (most) restrictive buffer zone. Do not contaminate sensitive habitats when cleaning and rinsing spray equipment and containers. Do not mix, load or apply within 15 metres of all wells. Runoff: Do not apply product during periods of intense rainfall or to soils saturated with water. Do not apply directly to standing  or running water. Do not apply in areas where surface water from treatment site can run off to adjacent cropland, either planted or to be planted, or into streams, irrigation waters or wells. Do not contaminate any body of water, including irrigation water.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: Use sufficient water volume for uniform coverage (minimum of 80 L/acre).   

## Application tips   

DOUBLE NICKEL® LC and DOUBLE NICKEL® 55 are most beneficial when applied in alternation with other fungicides that are registered for the specific use/pathogen or in a tank mix program with labelled fungicides as part of a disease management program. Mix only with fungicides having label instructions that do not prohibit such mixtures. The use of DOUBLE NICKEL® 55 in combination with other fungicides will help delay resistance to these fungicides.   

## How it works   

DOUBLE NICKEL® LC and DOUBLE NICKEL® 55 are broad-spectrum preventative biopesticides for suppression or partial suppression of fungal and bacterial diseases.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground sprayers, aerial application or by pivot or sprinkle irrigation. Do not apply registered  tank mixes listed above in potato, chickpea and canola with pivot or sprinkler irrigation. Water volume:   

Ground – 40 L/acre minimum except for potato and sugar beet where 80 L/acre minimum is recommended.  Aerial – 20 L/acre minimum. Do not apply more than 0.16 L/acre of Headline EC by aerial application.  Chemigation – application must be made without the use of end guns.   

## Application tips   

Good coverage is essential for effective disease control and higher water volumes tend to increase performance with dense canopies. Headline EC works best if it is applied in a preventive manner and performs best if applied in a regularly scheduled protective spray program. Do not apply more than 1 application of this product before alternating to a fungicide with an alternative mode of action.   

## How it works   

Pyraclostrobin has a protective effect because it inhibits spore germination and a curative effect due to the inhibition  of mycelial growth and sporulation of the fungus on the leaf surface. Headline is systemic within the leaf. Headline applied to the top surface of the leaf binds tightly in the waxy cuticle and also moves to the lower surface where it provides dual-sided protection against disease entry.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Rainfast in 1 hour. Grazing: Do not graze treated corn crops within 6 days of application. Do not feed alfalfa hay or forage to livestock. All other crops listed can be grazed or fed to livestock. Pre-harvest interval: Cereals – apply no later than the end of flowering. Corn – 7 days. Edible-podded legumes and succulent bean and pea – 7 days. Grasses (grown for seed) – 14 days. Potato – 3 days. Dry bean, field pea, faba bean and lentil – 30 days. Soybean, canola, canola quality Brassica juncea, mustard (oilseed and condiment), rapeseed – 21 days. Sugar beet – 7 days. Re-cropping: A plant-back restriction of 14 days is required for all crops not on the label. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Headline EC is toxic to aquatic organisms, non-target terrestrial plants and small mammals. Observe buffer zones specified on the label. Runoff: To reduce runoff from treated areas into aquatic habitats, avoid application to areas with a moderate to steep slope, compacted soil, or clay.

28.3 g/acre in 80 L of water/acre   

Early and late blight: repeat applications at 7 day intervals.White mould: apply at 7 - 14 day intervals.   

## Sugar beet   

Cercospora leaf spot (Cercospora beticola)   

Apply at 14-day intervals in rotation with fungicides labeled for this use.   

## Hemp   

Partial suppression: white mould (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), grey mould (Botrytis cinera)   

Begin as a preventative spray. Apply at 7 - 14 day intervals when only LifeGard WG will be applied. Use the shorter interval when high disease pressure is expected. When used as part of a rotational program with fungicides labelled for this use, repeat every 7 - 21 days.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground application only. Do not apply by air. Water volume: Use sufficient water for uniform coverage (80 L/acre).   

## Application tips   

LifeGard® WG should be applied preventatively, when conditions are conducive to disease development, but before disease is observed in the field.   

## How it works   

LifeGard® WG contains a biological disease control agent (Bacillus mycoides isolate J,or BmJ) that reduces the occurrence and severity of plant disease by inducing the plant’s natural defense mechanisms against pathogens through a mechanism known as Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR). BmJ itself has no direct effect on plant pathogens, but preventative applications (before infection or appearance of disease symptoms) can reduce the incidence and severity of subsequent disease. LifeGard® WG is most effective when used in conjunction with or alternation with fungicides having other modes of action, registered for the control of labelled diseases.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rainfast in 4 hours. Re-cropping: No restrictions. Pre-harvest interval: Potato, sugar beet: Can be applied up to and including the day of harvest. Hemp: 3 - 4 weeks. Re-entry interval: 4 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

May be toxic to bees. Do not apply this product if bees are visiting the treatment area. Avoid application when  heavy rain is forecast. To avoid runoff from treated areas, avoid application to areas with moderate to steep slopes, compacted soil or clay.   

## Toxicity   

Oral LD50

## Application tips   

Slurrying the product with fertilizer is not recommend nor supported. A dedicated application system for in furrow pesticide application should be used. A system of 2 nozzles per row unit on the planter is recommended. 1 nozzle should be pointing 20° down, spraying 6 to 8 inches across the open furrow just before the tuber in the furrow, and a second nozzle should be pointing 70° down, spraying 6 to 8 inches across the open furrow before the furrow is closed. Use of water rates greater than 40 L/acre is not recommended. May be used in conjunction with Vibrance Ultra Potato seed treatment.   

## How it works   

Orondis Gold Potato combines 2 active ingredients: oxathiapiprolin (Orondis) and metalaxyl-M (Ridomil Gold 480SL). Orondis Gold Potato is readily absorbed by the roots and provides protection against the above diseases under varied weather conditions.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Do not apply in greenhouses. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

Re-cropping: All legume crops, except succulent peas require a plant-back interval of 180 days. All other crops may be planted immediately following the last application.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not contaminate irrigation or drinking water supplies or aquatic habitats by cleaning of equipment or  disposal of wastes.

## How It works   

The 2 modes of action provide protection against late blight in potato. Orondis Ultra combines mandipropamid, with oxathiapiprolin. Oxathiapiprolin penetrates the leaf surface and moves upward in the plant to effectively protect existing plant material plus new growth.   

## Restrictions   

Maximum number of applications: Refer to each individual label. Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Pre-harvest interval: Potato 14 days. Re-cropping: For all legume crops except succulent pea, a plant-back interval of 180 days is required for Orondis Ultra B. Do not plant any crop that is not registered for use with Orondis Ultra A for a period of 30 days after the last application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Orondis Ultra B contains an active ingredient and aromatic petroleum distillates that are toxic to aquatic organisms. May be toxic to certain beneficial insects. Minimize spray drift to reduce harmful effects on beneficial insects. Oxathiapiprolin is persistent and may carry over. It is recommended that any products containing oxathiapiprolin  not be used in areas treated with this product during the previous season.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 40 L/acre minimum. Aerial – 20 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

Good coverage is essential for effective disease control. Priaxor works best if it is applied in a preventive manner prior to the development of disease. Do not apply more than 1 application of this product before alternating to a fungicide with an alternative mode of action. The use of a non-ionic surfactant is not required  but applications at 0.125% v/v will improve efficacy.   

## How it works   

The active ingredient fluxapyroxad is a carboximide (SDHI) fungicide with systemic activity. The active ingredient pyraclostrobin is a member of the strobilurin class of chemistry used as a broad spectrum fungicide.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Rainfast in one hour. Grazing: All crops can be grazed  or fed to livestock except grasses and alfalfa grown for seed, but observe minimum pre-harvest interval for each crop. Pre-harvest intervals: Cereals – Apply no later than end of flowering. Dry pea, lentil, chickpea, and dry bean – 30 days. Corn, soybean, canola, sunflower, flax – 21 days. Grasses grown for seed – 14 days. Sweet corn, edible legumes, succulent pea and bean, sugar beet – 7 days. Re-cropping: All labelled crops and tuberous and corm vegetables, sugar beet, legume vegetables, pome fruits, stone fruits may be planted immediately following the last application. A plant-back interval of one year is required for all other crops. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Observe buffer zones specified on the label. The use of this chemical may result in contamination of groundwater, particularly in areas where soils are permeable (e.g., sandy soils) and/or depth of the water table is shallow. Toxic to aquatic organisms, small mammals and non-target terrestrial plants.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application for foliar late blight. For seed applications, follow the manufacturer’s application instructions for the seed treatment equipment being used. Refer to label for more information on the maximum number of foliar applications allowed following the use of Revus as potato seed piece treatment. Do not apply more than 242 mL manipropamid/acre/year.   

Water volume: Ground – 40 L/acre minimum. Aerial – 18 L/acre minimum. Surfactant: Non-ionic adjuvant is recommended at 0.25%.   

## How it works   

After application, Revus adheres to the waxy cuticle of treated leaves, becomes rainfast and establishes a barrier  to prevent fungi from taking hold. The fungicide also enters the leaf to provide protection to both sides of the leaf. Revus also provides anti-germination effects. Disease spores that land on the plant are prevented from germinating.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Avoid application if heavy rain is forecast. Pre-harvest intervals: 14 days. Re-cropping: Do not plant any crop that is not registered for use with Revus for  a period of 30 days after the last application. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Do not apply this product directly to freshwater habitats. Do not contaminate irrigation or drinking water supplies  or aquatic habitats by cleaning of equipment or disposal of wastes. Runoff: To reduce runoff from treated areas into aquatic habitats, avoid application to areas with a moderate to steep slope, compacted soil or clay. Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast.

## Application information   

How to apply: Refer to label for details on application method for registered crops. Soil applications: Apply in a manner that will concentrate the product in the seed or root zone. Delivery of Serenade SOIL to the seed or root zone can be accomplished by in-furrow application, broadcast or banded applications on the soil surface or by surface drip irrigation. These application methods facilitate the colonization of crop roots with the active ingredient and optimize efficacy. For in-furrow applications spray Serenade SOIL in a narrow band with the spray directed at the seed and surrounding soil before covering the seed or seed piece. For broadcast or banded application to the soil surface, Serenade SOIL must be incorporated into the seed zone by rainfall or overhead irrigation within 24 hours.  Serenade SOIL may also be applied via overhead irrigation. Drip irrigation applications should be made with the first

irrigation after seeding or transplanting. Serenade SOIL may be injected or shanked into the soil, at the seed zone, prior to planting a crop. After crop germination or transplanting, additional applications of Serenade SOIL may be made. Such applications may include drip irrigation (surface or subsurface), soil directed sprays or shanking in. Use higher rates with broadcast applications and in fields with a history of disease problems. Serenade SOIL can be used in a rotational program with other registered fungicides that control the disease. Foliar applications: Use enough water to achieve good coverage.   

## Application tips   

Broadcast or band: Apply as a 15-cm band over the top of the seed row or as a broadcast spray after planting. Use higher rates for broadcast applications. Ensure incorporation into the seed zone within 24 hours of applications with rain or overhead irrigation. In-furrow application: Apply in-furrow in the appropriate amount of water per acre. Mount the spray nozzle so the spray is directed in the furrow just before the seed or seed-pieces are covered. Overhead irrigation: Apply with irrigation water, ensuring uniform coverage of the soil and incorporation of product into the seed zone. Surface drip irrigation: Apply product with the first irrigation after planting. Post-planting applications at any crop stage: Apply the finished spray mixture to the soil as a drench, spray or drip irrigation, directing it towards the base of the plant.

253 ml   

Apply at the very early stages of disease development.Maximum of 1 application per crop season.   

## Registered tank mixes   

None registered.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 40L/acre minimum. Aerial – 20 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

For Fusarium head blight spray coverage is essential. Spray equipment must be set up to ensure thorough coverage of all wheat heads.   

## How it works   

Tebuconazole and prothioconazole are broad spectrum fungicides for disease control in cereals with preventative and curative properties.   

## Restrictions   

Grazing: Do not allow livestock to graze or feed green forage to livestock less than 6 days after application. Straw cut after harvest may be fed or used for bedding. Pre-harvest intervals: Wheat, barley and oats – 36 days.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours. Re-cropping: Registered crops and soybeans may be replanted in treated areas as soon as practical after the last application. For all other crops, do not plant back within 120 days of last application.   

Rainfall: Avoid application when heavy rain is forecast. Product is rain fast in 2 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Tebuconazole is toxic to birds, small wild animals, aquatic organisms and non-target plants. Do not apply directly to water or to areas where surface water is present. Prothioconazole is toxic to aquatic organisms. Do not contaminate irrigation or drinking water supplies or aquatic habitats by cleaning of equipment or disposal of wastes. To reduce runoff from treated areas, consider the characteristics and conditions of the site before treatment.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 80 L/acre. Aerial – 16 - 20 L/acre.   

## Application tips   

Good coverage is essential for effective disease control. Any reduction in water volume can reduce disease control. Do not exceed 2 applications per season.   

## How it works   

Partially systemic. Propiconazole is transported upwards in plants. It has both preventive and curative activity. Length of control will vary from 3 to 4 weeks depending on disease, crop and environmental conditions.  Strongly absorbed by most soils.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: If rainfall occurs within 1 hour of application, re-application is necessary. Grazing: Do not graze  animals on treated green crops within 3 days of application. Do not feed straw from crops treated with herbicide tank mixes to livestock. Pre-harvest intervals: Wheat, barley and oats – 45 days. Canola – 60 days. Dry bean – 30 days. Timothy – 14 days. Corn – 30 days (field corn harvested for forage), 14 days (sweet corn). See label for pre-harvest intervals when tank mixing with a herbicide or an insecticide. Re-entry interval: Hand-harvesting and detasseling treated corn: 24 hours. All other crops and activities 12 hours. Re-cropping: Registered crops – 0 days from last application. All other crops – 105 days from last application.   

## Environmental precautions   

Propiconazole is toxic to fish. Do not spray any body of water by direct application, drift or by cleaning and rinsing spray equipment. Formulated products contain petroleum distillate that is moderately to highly toxic to aquatic organisms.

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 40 L/acre minimum. Aerial – 20 L/acre minimum.   

## Application tips   

Good coverage is essential for effective disease control and higher water volumes tend to increase performance with dense canopies. Tornado Pro works best if it is applied in a preventative manner. Do not apply more than once per year. Do not apply once the head is emerged.   

## How it works   

Pyraclostrobin has a protective effect because it inhibits spore germination and a curative effect due to the inhibition of mycelial growth and sporulation of the fungus on the leaf surface. It is systemic within the leaf. Tebuconazole is a broad-spectrum fungicide with preventive, curative and eradicative properties.

## Application information   

For soil applications (in-furrow) using ground equipment in potatoes, spray specified rate in a 10 - 15 cm band in-furrow at planting and cover with soil. For best results uniformly spray the band over the seed-pieces and soil. Apply in 20 - 60 L of water per acre.   

## Application tips   

Do not apply more than 200 g fluopyram/acre per year, regardless of formulation or method of application (soil or foliar). To limit the potential for development of disease resistance to this fungicide class do not make more than 2 sequential applications of Velum Prime or any other Group 7 containing fungicide before rotating with a fungicide from a different Group registered for the same use. Any nematode or fungal population may contain individuals naturally resistant to Velum Prime and other Group 7 nematicides/fungicides. A gradual or total loss of nematode control may occur over time if this product is used repeatedly in the same field. Other resistance mechanisms that are not linked to site of action, but specific for individual chemicals, such as enhanced metabolism, may also exist. Appropriate resistance-management strategies should be followed.

## Plant growth regulator use in   

## Alberta   

Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are synthetic compounds that can beneficially modify plant growth and development. These compounds function by altering hormonal activity to produce shorter stems, reduce lodging and maintain grain yield. PGRs are a tool that can help mitigate lodging pressure and are most useful in environments with abundant moisture and high levels of fertility.   

Research is ongoing to address many questions about PGRs. It is known that effective PGR applications require careful crop staging, but their use is not recommended under stressful environmental conditions, and responses are species and cultivar specific. However, PGRs can be a risk management tool to reduce lodging and yield losses commonly found in intensive management systems.   

## PGR performance   

Cereal species and cereal varieties differ in their sensitivity to PGRs. Wheat is generally most responsive and barley is less responsive when height reductions are used as a measure of efficacy. Significant differences in lodging response to PGR applications have been reported, depending on the cultivar. Not all cultivars respond equally well to PGRs, and the height or lodging rating of a cultivar is not a reliable indicator of PGR effectiveness.   

PGRs can have inconsistent responses between years, sites, cultivars and species. Alberta research suggests that 93% of the time, PGRs will cause significant wheat height reductions (between 3 and 13 cm) compared to no PGR application. However, there are occasional instances when some cultivars show no height reduction in response to PGR application.   

## PGR effects on plant growth   

PGRs are applied to the crop foliage and change plant physiology by reducing cell elongation, reducing stem length, shortening the uppermost internodes and peduncle. They may also alter stem diameter. However, plant hormones act in concert. The level of one hormone affects other hormones, so PGRs may have secondary effects, such as delayed senescence, increased resistance to environmental stress or shifting assimilates to the roots resulting in increased root growth. PGRs can positively or negatively affect yield, but results are inconsistent depending on crop lodging, environmental conditions, crop species and cultivar.   

PGRs are systemic but non-residual, which can result in undesirable side effects such as stem elongation in some cultivars and temporary, short-term height reduction. PGRs can also alter tiller growth.   

PGR applications are frequently associated with significant increases in crop greenness, delayed maturity (up to three days) and decreased thousand kernel weight. Farmers must weigh the benefits of PGRs against the chance of extended days to maturity, reduced test weight and the possibility of reduced protein content when deciding to use a PGR.   

## Grain marketing considerations   

PGRs are registered for use on certain crop types, however, not all grain markets will accept grain that has received a PGR application in the growing season. Farmers are advised to check the Keep it Clean website for product advisories. There are potential market risks associated with certain PGRs on certain crop types. As such, farmers should check with their grain buyer to confirm contract obligations and acceptance before use.

## Registered tank mixes   

None registered. Do not use in a tank mixture with liquid nitrogen fertilizer.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground – 40 L/acre minimum.  Aerial – 20 L/acre minimum.   

## Mixing instructions   

Use mixing instructions “a” as described on page 15   

## Application tips   

Do not apply Manipulator 620 to crops under stress from drought, excess moisture or nutrient deficiency. Best results from early morning or evening application. Applications of Manipulator 620 may be made under normal seasonal temperatures down to 1°C. Do not apply during periods of frost.   

## How it works   

Manipulator 620 affects the production of gibberellin, a plant hormone responsible for cell elongation resulting in plants with shorter, thicker stems.   

## Expected results   

Improved resistance to lodging through reduced plant height, enhanced root structure and improved stem characteristics.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rain within 2 hours may reduce effectiveness. Avoid application when heavy rain is forecasted. Grazing:   

Do not graze treated crops or cut for hay. Re-cropping: No cropping restrictions the year after application.   

Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Manipulator 620 is toxic to non-target terrestrial plants. Leaching: The use of this chemical may result in contamination of groundwater particularly in areas where soils are permeable (e.g., sandy soil) and/or the depth to the water table is shallow. Runoff: Reduce risk of runoff by avoiding application on moderate to steep slopes, compacted soil or clay. Buffer: For ground applications, use a 1-metre buffer between sprayed area and terrestrial habitat. For aerial applications, use a 10-metre buffer for fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircrafts in wheat (winter, spring and durum). Use a 15-metre buffer for fixed-wing aircrafts and a 10-metre buffer for rotary-wing aircrafts in barley (spring and winter) and oats (spring and winter).   

## Toxicity

## Registered tank mixes   

None registered.   

It is important to check the physical compatibility of tank mixes containing Moddus using a jar test following the WAMLEGS mixing order with proportionate amounts of mix partners, and water, before mixing in the spray tank. In some cases, tank mixing a pest control product, such as Moddus, with another pest control product or a fertilizer can result in biological effects that could include, but are not limited to, reduced efficacy or increased host crop injury.   

## Application information   

How to apply: Ground and aerial application. Water volume: Ground –   

40 L/acre minimum. Aerial (wheat and barley only) – 20 L/acre.   

Nozzles and Pressure: Ground: Use a hydraulic nozzle with 80° or 110° drift reducing flat fan (e.g., those with a pre-orifice or turbulence chamber) or air induction nozzles with up to 80 mesh screens. Do not use flood type nozzles, controlled droplet application equipment, spray foils or hollow cone nozzles. Use a combination of volume and pressure recommended by the nozzle manufacturer to achieve no finer than ASAE medium sized droplets.   

Screens: Use 50 mesh or coarser line strainers and screens or 80 mesh with air induction nozzles.   

## Application tips   

Due to risk of injury to the crop, avoid overlapping and do not apply to wheat, barley or oats that are or could become stressed, such as by low fertility, high temperatures, drought, frost or diseased or insect damage. Environmental conditions, crop management and cultural practices that affect plant growth and vigour will influence the response of the crop to Moddus applications.   

## How it works   

Moddus aids in the growth and lodging management of wheat, barley and oats and the growth of perennial ryegrass.   

## Restrictions   

Rainfall: Rain within 3 hours may reduce effectiveness. Preharvest interval: None indicated. Grazing restrictions:   

wheat, barley and oats – hay 30 days. Wheat and oats – forage – do not feed forage to livestock or permit livestock to graze. Re-cropping: Wheat, barley and oats (0 days); all other feed and food crops (30 days). Buffer Zones: None given. Re-entry interval: 12 hours.   

## Environmental precautions   

Runoff: Reduce risk of runoff by avoiding application on moderate to steep slopes, compacted soil or clay. Reduce risk of contaminating aquatic areas due to runoff by including a vegetative strip between the treated area and the edge of the water body.   

## Toxicity   

Oral LD50   

Oral (rat) > 5,050 mg/kg. Dermal LD50   

Oral (rat) > 4000 mg/kg.   

## Storage   

Keep in original container, tightly closed, during storage. Store this product away from food or feed. Store in a cool, dry, well ventilated area.
