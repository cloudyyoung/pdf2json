## PRECAUTIONARY STATEMENTS (continued)   

## Engineering Controls   

When applicators use closed systems or enclosed cabs in a manner that meets the requirements listed in the Worker Protection Standard (WPS) for agricultural pesticides [40 CFR 170.240(d)(5)], the handler PPE requirements may be reduced or modiﬁ ed as speciﬁ ed in the WPS.   

## User Safety Recommendations   

Users should:   

• Wash hands before eating, drinking, chewing gum, using tobacco or using the toilet.• Remove clothing/PPE immediately if pesticide gets inside. Then wash thoroughly and put on clean clothing.•  Remove PPE immediately after handling this product. Wash the outside of gloves before removing. As soon as possible, wash thoroughly and change into clean clothing.   

## Environmental Hazards   

Do not apply directly to water, to areas where surface water is present, or to intertidal areas below the mean high water mark. Do not contaminate water when disposing of equipment wash water or rinsate. This product contains atrazine, which has been shown to be toxic to aquatic invertebrates. Runoff and drift from treated areas may be hazardous to aquatic organisms in neigh-boring areas. Do not apply when weather conditions favor drift from treated areas.   

## Ground Water Advisory   

Acuron Herbicide contains the active ingredients atrazine, bicyclopyrone, mesotrione and S-metolachlor.   

Atrazine can travel (seep or leach) through soil and can enter ground water which may be used as drinking water. Atrazine has been found in ground water. Users are advised not to apply atrazine to sand and loamy sand soils where the water table (ground water) is close to the surface and where these soils are very permeable, i.e., well-drained. Your local agricultural agencies can provide further information on the type of soil in your area and the location of ground water.   

Bicyclopyrone is known to leach through soil into ground water under certain conditions as a result of label use. This chemical may leach into ground water if used in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow.   

S-metolachlor is known to leach through soil into ground water under certain conditions as a result of agricultural use. Use of this product in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow may result in ground water contamination.   

## Surface Water Advisory   

This product has a high potential for reaching surface water via runoff for several months or more after application. A level, well-maintained vegetative buffer strip between areas to which this product is applied and surface water features such as ponds, streams, and springs will reduce the potential loading of atrazine, bicyclopyrone, mesotrione and S-metolachlor from runoff water and sediment. Runoff of this product will be reduced by avoiding applications when rainfall or irrigation is expected to occur within 48 hours.   

## Mixing/Loading Instructions   

Care must be taken when using this product to prevent back-siphoning into wells, spills, or improper disposal of excess pesticide, spray mixtures, or rinsates.   

Check valves or antisiphoning devices must be used on mixing equipment.   

This product must not be mixed/loaded or used within 50 ft of wells, including abandoned wells, drainage wells, and sink holes. Operations that involve mixing, loading, rinsing, or washing to this product into or from pesticide handling or application equipment or containers within 50 ft of any well are prohibited, unless conducted on an impervious pad constructed to withstand the weight of the heaviest load that may be positioned on or moved across the pad. Such a pad shall be designed and maintained to contain any product spills or equipment leaks, container or equipment rinse or wash water, and rain water that may fall on the pad. Surface water shall not be allowed to either ﬂ ow over or from the pad, which means the pad must be self-contained. The pad shall be sloped to facilitate material removal. An unroofed pad shall   

be of sufﬁ cient capacity to contain, at a minimum, 110% of the capacity of the largest pesticide container or application equipment on the pad. A pad that is covered by a roof of sufﬁ cient size to completely exclude precipitation from contact with the pad shall have a minimum containment capacity of 100% of the capacity of the largest pesticide container or application equipment on the pad. Containment capacities as described above shall be maintained at all times. The above speciﬁ ed minimum containment capacities do not apply to vehicles when delivering pesticide shipments to the mixing/loading site.   

Additional State imposed requirements regarding well head setbacks and operational area containment must be observed.   

This product must not be mixed or loaded within 50 ft of perennial or intermittent streams and rivers, natural or impounded lakes and reservoirs. This product may not be applied within 66 ft of the points where ﬁ eld surface water runoff enters perennial or intermittent streams and rivers or within 200 ft from the edge of natural or impounded lakes and reservoirs. If this product is applied to highly erodible land, the 66 ft buffer or setback from runoff entry points must be planted to crop, or seeded with grass or other suitable crop.   

## Tile-Outletted Terraced Fields Containing Standpipes   

One of the following restrictions must be used in applying atrazine to tile-outletted terraced ﬁ elds containing standpipes:   

1. Do not apply this product within 66 ft of standpipes in tile-outletted terraced ﬁ elds.   

2.  Apply this product to the entire tile-outletted terraced ﬁ eld and immediately incorporate it to a depth of 2-3 inches in the entire ﬁ eld.   

3.  Apply this product to the entire tile-outletted terraced ﬁ eld under a no-till practice only when a high crop residue manage-ment practice is practiced. High crop residue management is described as a crop management practice where little or no crop residue is removed from the ﬁ eld during and after crop harvest.   

## Physical and Chemical Hazards   

Do not use or store near heat or open ﬂ ame.

## PRODUCT INFORMATION   

Acuron Herbicide may be used preemergence and postemergence in the culture of ﬁ eld corn, seed corn, and silage corn. Acuron Herbicide may also be used in the culture of sweet corn and yellow popcorn but the application must be made prior to crop emergence, (i.e., preemergence) or severe crop injury may occur.   

Acuron Herbicide is a combination of the herbicides: atrazine, bicyclopyrone, mesotrione and S-metolachlor plus the safener benoxacor. Acuron Herbicide is recommended for management of the weed species listed in Tables 1 and 2.   

## ATRAZINE, BICYCLOPYRONE, MESOTRIONE AND S-METOLACHLOR HERBICIDE RATE LIMITATIONS   

Certain states may have established rate limitations within speciﬁ c geographical areas for the use of atrazine. These more restrictive/protective requirements must be followed. Consult your state lead pesticide control agency for additional infor-mation. It is a violation of this label to deviate from state use regulations.   

•  When tank mixing or sequentially applying atrazine or products containing atrazine with Acuron Herbicide to corn, do not exceed an application rate of 2.0 lb active ingredient of atrazine per acre for any single application and the total pounds of atrazine applied (lb ai per acre) must not exceed 2.5 lb active ingredient per acre per year.   

• Maximum broadcast application rates for atrazine in corn must be as follows:   

   

°   

If no atrazine was applied prior to corn emergence, apply a maximum of 2.0 lb ai/A broadcast. If a postemergence treat-ment is required following an earlier herbicide application, the total atrazine applied may not exceed 2.5 lb ai/A per calendar year.   

   

°   

Apply a maximum of 2.0 lb ai/A as a single preemergence application on soils that are not highly erodible or on highly erodible soils (as deﬁ ned by the Natural Resource Conservation Service) if at least 30% of the soil is covered with plant residues.   

   

°   

Apply a maximum of 1.6 lb ai/A as a single preemergence application on highly erodible (as deﬁ ned by the Natural Resource Conservation Service) soils if <30% of the surface is covered with plant residues; or 2.0 lb ai/A if only applied postemergence.   

Note: For purposes of calculating total atrazine active ingredient applied, Acuron Herbicide contains 1.0 lb ai atrazine plus related per gallon.   

Do not exceed label dosage rates, nor combined maximum annual rates for mesotrione (no more than 0.24 lb of mesotrione active ingredient must be applied per acre of corn per year), and S-metolachlor (the maximum annual use rate per year is 3.71 lb ai/A for corn). Do not apply more than 0.045 lb ai/A per year of bicyclopyrone for corn.   

## ACURON HERBICIDE USE PRECAUTIONS   

•  Applied according to directions and under normal growing conditions, Acuron Herbicide will not harm the treated crop. During germination and early stages of growth, extended periods of unusually cold and wet or hot and dry weather, insect or plant disease attack, carryover pesticide residues, the use of certain soil applied systemic insecticides, improperly placed fertilizers or soil insecticides, may weaken crop seedlings. Acuron Herbicide used under these conditions could result in crop injury.   

•  Where reference is made to weeds partially controlled, partial control can either mean erratic control from good to poor or consistent control at a level below that generally considered acceptable for commercial weed control.   

•  Dry weather following preemergence application of Acuron Herbicide or an Acuron Herbicide tank mixture may reduce effectiveness. If possible, cultivate if weeds develop.   

•  Applying Acuron Herbicide postemergence to corn that has received an at-plant application of Counter® insecticide can result in severe corn injury. Temporary corn injury may occur if Acuron Herbicide is applied to emerged corn where organophos-phate insecticides other than Counter were applied at planting.   

•  Postemergence (emerged corn) applications of any organophosphate or carbamate insecticide within 7 days before or 7 days after an Acuron Herbicide application may result in severe corn injury.   

## ACURON HERBICIDE USE RESTRICTIONS   

•  Grazing Restriction: To avoid possible illegal residues, do not graze or feed forage from treated areas for 45 days following application.   

•  Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI): Corn (for grain, seed, or silage) may be treated up to 12 inches tall. Do not harvest forage within 60 days after application.   

• Do not apply more than 3.0 qt of Acuron Herbicide per acre in a single application.   

• Do not apply more than 3.0 qt of Acuron Herbicide per acre per year.   

• Do not make more than two Acuron Herbicide applications per year.   

• Do not make the second application within 14 days of the ﬁ rst application.   

• Do not use aerial application to apply Acuron Herbicide.   

• Do not apply Acuron Herbicide to sweet corn or yellow popcorn after the crop has emerged or severe crop injury may occur.   

•  Do not use Acuron Herbicide on any crop other than corn (for grain, seed, or silage), sweet corn (preemergence applications only) or yellow popcorn (preemergence applications only).   

• Do not use Acuron Herbicide in the culture of white popcorn or ornamental (Indian) corn or injury may occur.   

• Do not contaminate irrigation water used for crops or water used for domestic purposes.   

•  Thoroughly clean sprayer or other application device before using. Dispose of cleaning solution in a responsible manner. Do not use a sprayer or applicator contaminated with other materials, or crop damage or sprayer clogging of the application device may occur.   

• Read and observe all precautions and limitations on this label and the label of each product used in tank mixtures.   

•  Do not make postemergence (emerged corn) applications of Acuron Herbicide in a tank mix with any organophosphate or carbamate insecticide, or severe corn injury may occur.   

•  Do not apply under conditions which favor runoff or wind erosion of soil containing this product to non-target areas. To prevent off-site movement due to runoff or wind erosion:   

   

°   

Avoid treating powdery dry or light sand soils when conditions are favorable for wind erosion. Under these conditions, the soil surface should ﬁ rst be settled by rainfall or irrigation.   

   

°   

Do not apply to impervious substrates, such as paved or highly compacted surfaces.   

   

°   

Do not use tail water from the ﬁ rst ﬂ ood or furrow irrigation of treated ﬁ elds to treat nontarget crops, unless at least   

1/2inch of rainfall has occurred between application and the ﬁ rst irrigation.

HERBICIDE   

Naturally occurring biotypes of certain weed species with resistance to triazines, ALS, PPO, Glycine (glyphosate) and HPPD herbi-cides are known to exist. If biotypes of weeds resistant to triazines, ALS, PPO and glycine inhibitors are present in the ﬁ eld, this herbicide should control them if they are listed in Tables 1 and 2.   

To reduce the risk of weeds developing resistance to HPPD inhibitors, implement a program including both preemergence and/or postemergence herbicides that provide effective control of all weeds using multiple modes of action. This includes scouting ﬁ elds before application to ensure the herbicide will be appropriate for the weeds present. Scout ﬁ elds and eliminate weed escapes. If suspected weed resistance is observed against a particular weed species contact your Syngenta or retailer representa-tive or call Syngenta Customer Service (1-800-334-9481). Lack of weed control is not necessarily an indicator of weed resistance.   

Consider weed resistance management strategies that include two or more modes of action where a minimum of two modes of action are effective at controlling the target weed when either are applied alone.   

Read and follow all label directions.   

Acuron Herbicide contains four herbicide active ingredients and three modes of action and can be an effective component of a weed resistance management strategy.   

## Principles of Herbicide Resistant Weed Management   

Scout and know your ﬁ eld   

• Know weed species present in the ﬁ eld to be treated through scouting and ﬁ eld history. An understanding of weed biology is useful in designing a resistance management strategy. Ensure the weed management program will control all weeds present.• Fields should be scouted prior to application to determine species present and growth stage. Always apply this herbicide at the full labeled rate and correct timing for the weeds present in the ﬁ eld.   

Utilize non-herbicidal practices to add diversity   

• Use diversiﬁ ed management tactics such as cover crops, mechanical weed control, harvest weed seed control, and crop rotation as appropriate.   

Use good agronomic practices, start clean and stay clean   

• Use good agronomic practices that enhance crop competitiveness.• Plant into weed-free ﬁ elds utilizing tillage or an effective burndown herbicide for control of emerged weeds.• Sanitize farm equipment to avoid spreading seed or vegetative propagules prior to leaving ﬁ elds.   

Difﬁ cult to control weeds   

• Fields with difﬁ cult to control weeds should be planted in rotation with crops that allow the use of herbicides with an alternative mode of action or different management practices.• Difﬁ cult to control weeds may require sequential applications, such as a broad spectrum preemergence herbicide followed by one or more postemergence herbicide applications. Utilize herbicides containing different modes of action effective on the target weeds in sequential applications.   

Do not overuse the technology   

• Do not use more than two applications of this or any other herbicide with the same mode of action in a single growing season unless mixed with an herbicide with a different mode of action which provides overlapping spectrum for the difﬁ cult to control weeds.   

Scout and inspect ﬁ elds following application   

• Prevent an inﬂ ux of weeds into the ﬁ eld by controlling weeds in ﬁ eld borders.• Scout ﬁ elds after application to verify that the treatment was effective.• Suspected- herbicide resistant weeds may be identiﬁ ed by these indicators• Failure to control a weed species normally controlled by the herbicide at the dose applied, especially if control is achieved on adjacent weeds;• A spreading patch of non-controlled plants of a particular weed species; and• Surviving plants mixed with controlled individuals of the same species.• Report non-performance of this product to your Syngenta retailer, Syngenta representative, or call 1-866-Syngent(a) (866-796-4368). If resistance is suspected ensure weed escapes are controlled using an herbicide with an effective mode of action and/or use non-chemical means to prevent further seed production.   

Prevent weed escapes before, during, and after harvest   

• Do not allow weed escapes to produce seed or vegetative structures such as tubers or stolons which contribute to spread and survival. Consider harvest weed seed management and control weeds post-harvest to prevent seed production.   

Resistant weeds   

• Contact your local Syngenta representative, retailer, crop advisor or extension agent to determine if weeds resistant to modes of action contained in this product are present in your area. Do not assume that each listed weed is being con-trolled by multiple modes of action. Premixes are intended to broaden the spectrum of weeds that are controlled. Some weeds may be controlled by only one of the active ingredients in this product. If resistant biotypes have been reported, use the full labeled rate of this product, apply at the labeled timing, and tank mix with an additional different mode of action product so there are multiple effective modes of application for each suspected resistant weed.   

## SOIL ORGANIC MATTER   

Determine the organic matter of the soil on which the application is to be made prior to application. The use rate of Acuron Herbicide is based on percent soil organic matter.   

## REDUCED AND NO-TILL SYSTEMS   

Acuron Herbicide may be used in reduced and no-till systems. The highest levels of control will be obtained when applications are made as close to planting as possible. It is advised that a burndown herbicide including Gramoxone®, Roundup®, glyphosate or 2,4-D be tank mixed with Acuron Herbicide in reduced or no-till systems if weeds are present at application and the corn has not yet emerged.   

## WEEDS CONTROLLED   

Acuron Herbicide applied as directed in this label will control or suppress the weeds listed in Tables 1 and 2. Additional weeds may be controlled with tank mixes. See the Acuron Herbicide Tank Mix Combinations section for speciﬁ ed tank mix combina-tions. Always consult the tank mix product labels for speciﬁ c rates and use directions.

## ROTATIONAL CROPS   

When Acuron Herbicide is applied as directed on this label, follow the crop rotation intervals in Table 3. If Acuron Herbicide is tank mixed with other products, follow the most restrictive product’s crop rotation interval. It is the pesticide user’s responsi-bility to ensure that all products are registered for the intended use. Read and follow the applicable restrictions and limitations and directions for use on all product labels involved in tank mixing. Users must follow the most restrictive directions for use and precautionary statements of each product in the tank mixture.   

Do not rotate to food or feed crops other than those listed on this label.

## Cover Crops   

A cover crop can be an important tool for the overall farm cropping system. Cover crops are planted for conservation purposes, soil erosion control, soil health improvement, water quality improvement and weed management. A cover crop can be a single crop or a combination of crops, including grasses and/or broadleaf crops.   

After harvest of an Acuron Herbicide treated crop, planting of a cover crop is allowed provided the cover crop is not grazed or fed to livestock nor harvested for food. Terminate the cover crop through natural causes such as frost or intentional termination by herbicide application, crimping, rolling, tillage or cutting.   

All possible cover crops or cover crop combinations have not been tested for crop safety to Acuron Herbicide. Before planting the cover crop, determine the level of crop safety for the intended cover crops by conducting a ﬁ eld bioassay. Refer to the Field Bioassay for Cover Crops section below for instructions.   

## Field Bioassay for Cover Crops   

A ﬁ eld bioassay is a method of determining if herbicide residues are present in the soil at concentrations high enough to adversely affect crop growth.   

Conduct the ﬁ eld bioassay by planting several strips of the desired cover crop across the ﬁ eld which has been previously treated with Acuron Herbicide. Plant the cover crop strips perpendicular to the direction of the Acuron Herbicide application. The strips should be located so that all the different ﬁ eld conditions are encountered, including differences in ﬁ eld terrain, soil texture, organic matter, pH, and drainage.   

If the cover crop does not show adverse effects such as crop injury and/or stand reduction, the ﬁ eld can be planted to this cover crop. If injury and/or stand reduction are visible, wait two to four weeks for further herbicide degradation to occur and repeat the bioassay. Alternatively, select a different cover crop and repeat the bioassay. Only plant cover crops that show acceptable crop safety in the ﬁ eld bioassay.   

## APPLICATION PROCEDURES   

## ADJUVANTS   

When an adjuvant is to be used with this product, the use of an adjuvant that meets the standards of the Chemical Producers and Distributors Association (CPDA) adjuvant certiﬁ cation program is recommended.   

Where Acuron Herbicide is applied after the corn has emerged, a non-ionic surfactant (NIS) at 0.25% v/v (1 qt/100 gal) may be used. In addition to NIS, a spray grade ammonium sulfate (AMS) at 8.5-17.0 lb/100 gallons of water may also be used. When using liquid AMS products, use a rate that delivers an AMS equivalent of 8.5-17.0 lb/100 gallons of water. The use of crop oil concentrate (COC) may result in temporary crop injury. Do not use methylated seed oil (MSO) or urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) with Acuron Herbicide when applied alone to emerged corn, or when Acuron Herbicide is applied as a postemergence tank mixture with other products, unless directed for a speciﬁ c tank mix on this label or as part of a supplemental Acuron Herbicide label. Any of these adjuvants may be used at a preemergence or preplant timing, i.e. where the corn crop has not yet emerged to increase burndown activity on existing weeds. Do not apply Acuron Herbicide to emerged sweet corn or yellow popcorn or severe crop injury may occur.   

For Acuron Herbicide tank mixtures with Ignite® or Liberty® Herbicides applied to emerged ﬁ eld corn (LibertyLink® hybrids only), AMS may be added as directed on the Ignite or Liberty label. However, AMS must be the only adjuvant added to this tank mixture, or severe crop injury may occur. It is the pesticide user’s responsibility to ensure that all products are registered for the intended use. Read and follow the applicable restrictions and limitations and directions for use on all product labels involved in tank mixing. Users must follow the most restrictive directions for use and precautionary statements of each product in the tank mixture.   

Sprinkler Irrigation: Do not apply Acuron Herbicide by sprinkler irrigation. Use a sprinkler system only to incorporate Acuron Herbi-cide after application. After Acuron Herbicide has been applied, a sprinkler irrigation system set to deliver   

1/2-1 inch of water may be used to incorporate the product. Using more than 1 inch of water could result in reduced performance. On sandy soil low in organic matter, use no more than 1/2 inch of water. Do not use ﬂ ood irrigation to apply or incorporate Acuron Herbicide.   

## FERTILIZER IMPREGNATION   

Acuron Herbicide may be impregnated or coated onto dry bulk fertilizers including ammonium phosphate-sulfate, ammonium sulfate (AMS), diammonium phosphate (DAP), monoammonium phosphate (MAP), potash (potassium chloride), potassium sulfate, urea, or blends of these dry bulk fertilizer types.   

When applying Acuron Herbicide on dry bulk fertilizer, follow all directions for use and precautions on the product label regard-ing target crops, application rate, timing of application and all precautions and restrictions.   

All individual state regulations relating to dry bulk granular fertilizer blending, registration, labeling, and application are the responsibility of the mixer and applicator.   

Apply a minimum of 200 lb of dry bulk fertilizer impregnated with Acuron Herbicide at the speciﬁ ed broadcast rate per acre. For best results, apply the mixture uniformly to the soil with properly calibrated equipment immediately after blending. Uniform application of the blended fertilizer/herbicide mixture is essential to prevent possible crop injury and achieve weed control. Non-uniform application will result in unsatisfactory weed control. In areas where tillage is practiced, a shallow incorporation of the blended fertilizer/herbicide mixture is advised for improved weed control.   

Calculate amount of Acuron Herbicide needed by the following formula:   

2,000   

lb of fertilizers per acre   

X   

qt/A of Acuron Herbicide   

=   

qt ofAcuron Herbicideper ton of fertilizer   

## Blended Mixing Instructions   

Prepare the fertilizer/herbicide mixture by using any closed drum, belt, ribbon, or other commonly used dry bulk fertilizer blender. Nozzles used to spray Acuron Herbicide onto the fertilizer must be placed to provide uniform spray coverage. Care must be taken to aim the spray directly onto the fertilizer and avoid spraying the walls of the blender.   

If the fertilizer/herbicide blend is too wet for uniform application, adding a drying agent is advised. Add the drying agent slowly to the fertilizer/herbicide blend until the mixture is suitable for uniform application. The amount of drying agent needed will depend on fertilizer type, Acuron Herbicide application rate and amount of fertilizer used.   

Apply the fertilizer/herbicide blend immediately following impregnation.   

## Pneumatic (Compressed Air) Application:   

Acuron Herbicide may be applied through pneumatic applicators, whether the fertilizer/herbicide mixture is blender-mixed or on-board fertilizer impregnation system.   

Acuron Herbicide must not be mixed with any other liquid or dry material in on-board fertilizer impregnation system tanks. Use high quality fertilizer with a minimum of ﬁ nes when applying Acuron Herbicide with on-board impregnation equipment.   

Drying agents are not advised for use with on-board impregnation systems.   

## Precautions   

(1)  To avoid potential for explosion, do not impregnate Acuron Herbicide onto ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, or sodium nitrate either alone or in blends with other fertilizers.   

(2)  Do not impregnate Acuron Herbicide onto single super phosphate or triple superphosphate fertilizers.   

(3)  Do not impregnate Acuron Herbicide on straight unadulterated agricultural limestone, since absorption will not be achieved.   

## CULTIVATION   

Should weeds develop; a shallow cultivation or rotary hoeing will generally result in improved weed control. If Acuron Herbicide was incorporated, cultivate less than half the depth of incorporation.   

If cultivation is necessary due to soil crusting, compaction, or escaped weeds, adjust equipment to run shallow and minimize soil movement. This will decrease the possibility of diluting or moving the herbicide from the weed control zone.   

## SPRAY EQUIPMENT   

## Ground Application   

Spray nozzles should be uniformly spaced, the same size and type, and should provide accurate and uniform application. Use spray nozzles that provide medium to coarse droplet size to avoid drift yet provide good coverage. Ensure that all in-line strainer and nozzle screens in the sprayer are 50-mesh or coarser. Use a pump that can maintain the manufacturer’s recommended pressure at the nozzles and provide proper agitation within the tank to keep the product dispersed. Lower pressures may be used with extended range or drift reduction nozzles as long as adequate coverage is maintained. Always ensure that agitation is maintained until spraying is completed, even if stopped for brief periods of time. If the agitation is stopped for more than 5 minutes, re-suspend the spray solution by running on full agitation prior to spraying.   

Preemergence: Apply in a spray volume of 10-80 gal/A.   

Early Postemergence: Good weed coverage is essential for optimum weed control. Boom height for broadcast over-the-top applications must be based on the height of the crop – at least 15 inches above the crop canopy, but only high enough to give uniform coverage. Apply in a spray volume of 10-30 gal/A. When weed foliage is dense, use a minimum spray volume of 20 gal/A. Flat fan nozzles of 80° or 110° are recommended for optimum postemergence coverage. Do not use ﬂ oodjet nozzles or controlled droplet application equipment for postemergence applications. Nozzles may be angled forward 45° to enhance penetration of the crop and provide better coverage.   

## Aerial Prohibition   

Do not apply by air.   

## Spray Drift   

Do not apply when weather conditions may cause drift to nontarget areas. Drift may result in injury to adjacent crops and vegetation. To avoid spray drift, DO NOT apply when the wind speed is greater than 10 mph or during periods of temperature inversions.   

AVOIDING SPRAY DRIFT AT THE APPLICATION SITE IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATOR.   

The interaction of equipment and weather related factors determine the potential for spray drift. The applicator is responsible for considering these factors when making a decision.   

## Information on Droplet Size   

The most effective way to reduce spray drift potential is to apply large droplets. Use only nozzles producing medium to ultra coarse droplets. Do not use nozzles producing ﬁ ne droplets.   

## Controlling Droplet Size   

•  Volume - Use high ﬂ ow rate nozzles to apply the highest practical spray volume. Nozzles with higher rated ﬂ ows produce larger droplets.   

•  Pressure - Do not exceed the nozzle manufacturer’s recommended pressures. For many nozzle types, lower pressure produces larger droplets. When higher ﬂ ow rates are needed, use higher rate nozzles instead of increasing pressure.   

• Number of Nozzles - Use the minimum number of nozzles that provide uniform coverage.   

## Application Height   

Applications must be made at the lowest height above the target area that still provides uniform coverage of the target. Making applications at the lowest yet effective height reduces exposure of droplets to wind.   

## Wind   

Drift potential is lowest when wind speeds are 10 mph or less. However, many factors, including droplet size, pressure, and equipment type determine drift potential at any given wind speed. Note: Local terrain can inﬂ uence wind patterns.   

Leave a 25-foot buffer downwind of the application to avoid drift to non-target areas. This buffer may be untreated corn rows or ﬁ eld border species maintained for this purpose.   

## Temperature Inversions   

Applications must not occur during a temperature inversion because drift potential is high. Temperature inversions restrict vertical air mixing, which causes small suspended droplets to remain in a concentrated cloud. This cloud can move in unpredictable direc-tions due to the light variable winds common during inversions. Temperature inversions are characterized by increasing tempera-tures with altitude and are common on nights with limited cloud cover and light to no wind. They begin to form as the sun sets and often continue into the morning. Their presence can be indicated by ground fog; however, if fog is not present, inversionscan also be identiﬁ ed by the movement of smoke from a ground source or an aircraft smoke generator. Smoke that layers and moves laterally in a concentrated cloud (under low wind conditions) indicates an inversion, while smoke that moves upward and rapidly dissipates, indicates good vertical air mixing.   

## Non-Target Areas   

Do not apply this pesticide when the product may drift to non-target areas (i.e. residential areas, bodies of water, known habitat for threatened or endangered species, non-target crops).   

## Cleaning Equipment After Application   

Special attention must be given to cleaning equipment before spraying a crop other than corn. Mix only as much spray solution as needed.   

1. Flush tank, hoses, boom, and nozzles with clean water.2.  Prepare a cleaning solution of 1 gal of household ammonia per 25 gal of water. Many commercial spray tank cleaners may be used.3.   

Use a pressure washer to clean the inside of the spray tank with this solution. Take care to wash all parts of the tank, including the inside top surface. If a pressure washer is not available, completely ﬁ ll the sprayer with the cleaning solution to ensure contact of the cleaning solution with all internal surfaces of the tank and plumbing. Start agitation in the sprayer and thoroughly recirculate the cleaning solution for at least 15 minutes. Remove all visible deposits from the spraying system.   

4. Flush hoses, spray lines, and nozzles for at least 1 minute with the cleaning solution.5. Dispose of rinsate from steps 1-3 in an appropriate manner.6. Repeat steps 2-5.7. Remove nozzles, screens, and strainers and clean separately in the ammonia solution after completing the above procedures.8. Rinse the complete spraying system with clean water.   

## MIXING PROCEDURES   

## CARRIER   

Preemergence Applications: Either clean water or liquid fertilizers, excluding suspension fertilizers, may be used as carriers for preemergence applications. If ﬂ uid fertilizers are used, a compatibility test must be done. See Compatibility Test section for compatibility testing. Even if Acuron Herbicide is physically compatible with a ﬂ uid fertilizer, constant agitation is necessary to maintain a uniform mixture during application.   

Postemergence Applications: Use only clean water as the carrier when applying Acuron Herbicide after corn emergence. Do not apply Acuron Herbicide to emerged sweet corn or yellow popcorn.   

## ADDING ACURON HERBICIDE TO THE SPRAY TANK   

The spray tank must be clean, thoroughly rinsed and decontaminated before adding either Acuron Herbicide alone or with tank mix partners. If water is used as the carrier, use clean water.   

Acuron Herbicide Applied Alone: When Acuron Herbicide is used alone, add the speciﬁ ed amount of Acuron Herbicide to the spray tank when the tank is half full of the carrier, then add the rest of the water or ﬂ uid fertilizer. Provide sufﬁ cient agitation during mixing and application to maintain a uniform mixture.   

Acuron Herbicide Applied in Tank Mixtures: Refer to the sections on this label for speciﬁ ed tank mixes. Always refer to labels of the tank mix partners for mixing directions and precautions. Do not exceed label dosage rates, nor combined maximum yearly doses for atrazine, bicyclopyrone, mesotrione, or S-metolachlor. This product cannot be mixed with any product bearing a label prohibition against such mixing. It is the pesticide user’s responsibility to ensure that all products are registered for the intended use. Read and follow the applicable restrictions and limitations and directions for use on all product labels involved in tank mixing. Users must follow the most restrictive directions for use and precautionary statements of each product in the tank mixture. If a tank mixture is used, a compatibility test must be done. See Compatibility Test section for details on the procedure for such a test.   

If the tank mix partner is compatible, ﬁ ll the tank half full of the carrier. Start and continue agitation throughout mixing and spraying. All return lines to the spray tank must discharge below the liquid level. Prepare the components and add in the following order:   

1.  If a wettable powder or dry ﬂ owable formulation is used, make a slurry with water and add it slowly through the screen into the tank. Agitate during the procedure.   

2.  If a ﬂ owable formulation is used, add slowly through screen into the tank. Mixing and compatibility may be improved when a dry ﬂ owable is diluted with water before adding to the tank.   

3. Add Acuron Herbicide.   

4. Add any other tank mix products next with emulsiﬁ able concentrates added last.   

5. Add an adjuvant last, if needed.   

6.  Complete ﬁ lling the sprayer tank and continue agitation. Apply as soon as possible after spray mixture is prepared. Do not leave mixture in spray tank overnight without agitation or unattended.   

## TANK MIX COMPATIBILITY TEST   

A compatibility test is advised before tank mixing to ensure compatibility of Acuron Herbicide with other pesticides. The follow-ing test assumes a spray volume of 25 gal/A. For other spray volumes, make appropriate changes in the ingredients.   

Note: Nitrogen solutions or complete liquid fertilizers, excluding suspension fertilizers, may replace all or part of the water in the spray. Because liquid fertilizers vary, even within the same analysis, always check compatibility with pesticide(s) before use.   

Incompatibility of tank mixtures is more common with mixtures of fertilizer and pesticides.   

## Test Procedure   

1.  Add 1.0 pt of carrier (fertilizer or water) to each of two 1 qt jars with tight lids. Note: Use the same source of water that will be used for the tank mix and conduct the test at the temperature the tank mix will be applied.2.  To one of the jars, add   

1/4 tsp or 1.2 milliliters of a compatibility agent approved for this use, such as Compex® or Unite®   

(1/4 tsp is equivalent to 2.0 pt/100 gal spray). Shake or stir gently to mix.3.  To both jars, add the appropriate amount of pesticide(s) in their relative proportions based on speciﬁ ed label rates. If more than one pesticide is used, add them separately with dry pesticides ﬁ rst, ﬂ owables next, and emulsiﬁ able concentrates last. After each addition, shake or stir gently to thoroughly mix.4.   

After adding all ingredients, put lids on and tighten, and invert each jar 10 times to mix. Let the mixtures stand 15-30 minutes and then look for separation, large ﬂ akes, precipitates, gels, heavy oily ﬁ lm on the jar, or other signs of incompatibility. Deter-mine if the compatibility agent is needed in the spray mixture by comparing the two jars. If either mixture separates, but can be remixed readily, the mixture can be sprayed as long as good agitation is used. If the mixtures are incompatible, test the follow-ing methods of improving compatibility: (a) slurry the dry pesticide(s) in water before addition, or (b) add 1/2 the compatibility agent to the fertilizer or water and the other   

1/2 to the emulsiﬁ able concentrate or ﬂ owable pesticide before addition to the mixture. If incompatibility is still observed, do not use the mixture.5.  After compatibility testing is complete, dispose of any pesticide wastes in accordance with the Storage and Disposal section in this label.   

## CROP USE DIRECTIONS   

Acuron Herbicide is to be used for preemergence use for control of most annual grass and broadleaf weeds in ﬁ eld corn, seed corn, silage corn, sweet corn and yellow popcorn. Acuron Herbicide may also be applied early postemergence for the control of broadleaf weeds in ﬁ eld corn, seed corn and silage corn. Do not apply Acuron Herbicide to emerged sweet corn or yellow popcorn or severe crop injury will occur.   

See Table 1 and 2 for a list of weeds controlled.   

Acuron Herbicide Use Rate: Determine the soil organic matter content of the ﬁ eld on which Acuron Herbicide is to be applied and then refer to Table 4 to determine application rate. On soils with greater than 10% organic matter, Acuron Herbicide activity may be affected resulting in reduced or poor weed control.

## ACURON HERBICIDE APPLIED ALONE   

Early Preplant: Acuron Herbicide may be applied up to 28 days prior to planting.   

Preemergence Surface: Acuron Herbicide may be applied to the soil surface as a broadcast or banded application.   

Early Postemergence: Acuron Herbicide may be applied after corn (for grain, seed, or silage) emergence. See the “Adjuvants”   

section of this label for speciﬁ c directions. Do not apply early postemergence to corn in liquid fertilizer or severe crop injury may occur. Apply this treatment to small broadleaf weeds (less than 3 inches tall). Occasional corn leaf burn may result, but this will not affect later growth or corn yield. Do not apply Acuron Herbicide to emerged sweet corn or yellow popcorn or severe crop injury may occur. Postemergence applications to corn must be made before crop reaches 12 inches in height.   

This product will not provide consistent control of emerged grass weeds. For control of emerged grass weeds a grass herbicide tank mix may be required (see tank mix section of this label).   

If Bicep II Magnum®, Bicep Lite II Magnum®, AAtrex® (atrazine), Dual Magnum®, or Dual II Magnum® alone or in tank mixtures have been applied early preplant, preplant surface, preplant incorporated, or preemergence, limit the Acuron Herbicide early post application to not exceed a total of 2.5 lb of active ingredient of atrazine or 3.75 lb of S-metolachlor active per acre, or illegal residues may result.   

Split Application: Acuron Herbicide may be applied as a split application in corn (for grain, seed, or silage). For a split application program, apply   

1/2 to   

2/3 of the labeled rate of Acuron Herbicide prior to crop emergence followed by a second Acuron Herbicide application at   

1/3 to   

1/2 of the labeled rate as a post application after corn emergence. The total amount of Acuron Herbicide applied in the split application program cannot exceed 3.0 qt/A per year. Do not make more than two Acuron Herbicide appli-cations per year. Do not make the second application within 14 days of the ﬁ rst application. Refer to the Early Postemergence   

section above for instructions on postemergence applications.   

## ACURON HERBICIDE TANK MIX COMBINATIONS   

## Use of Spray Adjuvants with Tank Mixtures   

When Acuron Herbicide is used as a preemergence herbicide, and before weeds have emerged, spray adjuvants have little or no inﬂ uence on performance. However, in burndown situations where the weeds have emerged and the corn has not, an adjuvant may be used with Acuron Herbicide applied alone or when applied in tank mixture with a burndown herbicide as allowed on the individual product labels. Use only those adjuvants approved for agricultural crop use. See the “Adjuvants” section under   

“Application Procedures” for further instructions.   

## Burndown Combinations for Reduced Tillage Situations   

In reduced or no-till corn and before the crop has emerged, Acuron Herbicide tank mixes with Gramoxone, Roundup or glypho-sate will burndown emerged weeds. For best results, apply tank mixes of Acuron Herbicide plus Gramoxone to emerged weeds that are 1-6 inches in height. Consult the Gramoxone, Roundup or glyphosate product label for further information on weeds controlled and application timings.   

## Preemergence Tank Mixtures Applied Before Corn Emergence   

The tank mix partners listed in Table 5 may be used in either conventional, reduced, or no-till systems and be applied by the same methods and at the same timings as Acuron Herbicide unless otherwise speciﬁ ed in the tank mix product label. Follow all tank mix product labels for use rates and restrictions. Perform a compatibility test prior to spraying the tank mix application. Tank mixtures with 2,4-D are allowed, but must only be done with extreme care with regard to ensuring compatibility before mixing a load. 2,4-D products, and even batches, vary greatly with regard to compatibility and must be checked each time a water or carrier source, water or carrier temperature, product source, or tank mixture recipe is changed.

## Acuron Herbicide Programs with Glyphosate in Roundup Ready® or Agrisure® GT Corn   

Acuron Herbicide may be applied early postemergence at a rate of 1.5-3.0 qt/A in tank mixture with a solo glyphosate product (e.g. Roundup) that is registered for use over-the-top in Roundup Ready or Agrisure GT ﬁ eld corn. To minimize weed competi-tion with the crop, target the application of this mixture to weeds in the 1 to 2 inch range. Do not apply this mixture to corn that is greater than 12 inches tall. If the glyphosate product has a built-in adjuvant system (i.e. the product label does not ask for additional adjuvant), only spray-grade ammonium sulfate (AMS) at 8.5 lb/100 gal may be added to this mixture. If the glypho-sate product label calls for an adjuvant in addition to AMS, add a non-ionic surfactant (NIS) at 0.25% v/v and AMS to this spray mixture. Do not add urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), crop oil concentrate (COC), or methylated seed oil (MSO) type adjuvants to these mixtures, or crop injury may occur. Follow all directions for use and restrictions on the glyphosate product label.   

Alternatively, Acuron Herbicide may be applied preemergence at a rate down to 2 qt/A as part of a two-pass weed control system when followed by a postemergence application of a glyphosate based product in Roundup Ready or Agrisure GT corn. When used in this way, Acuron Herbicide will provide reduced competition of the weeds listed in Table 1 for a period of 30 or more days, thus improving the timing ﬂ exibility and effectiveness of the glyphosate based product application. Follow all directions for use and restrictions on the glyphosate product label.   

Acuron Herbicide may be applied preemergence at 1.25-1.5 qt/A as part of a two-pass weed control system when followed by Halex® GT postemergence in Roundup Ready or Agrisure GT corn. Follow all directions for use and restrictions on each product label.   

## Acuron Herbicide Programs for LibertyLink Corn   

Acuron Herbicide may be applied early postemergence at a rate of 1.5-2.0 qt/A in tank mixture with Ignite or Liberty and applied over-the-top in ﬁ eld corn designated as LibertyLink. To minimize weed competition with the crop, target the application of this mixture to weeds in the 1 to 2 inch range. Do not apply this mixture to corn that is greater than 12 inches tall. Ammonium sulfate (AMS) may be added as a spray adjuvant as directed on the Ignite or Liberty label. However, AMS must be the only adjuvant added to this tank mixture. Do not add urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), crop oil concentrate (COC), non-ionic surfactants (NIS), or methylated seed oil (MSO) type adjuvants to these mixtures, or crop injury may occur. Follow all directions for use and restrictions on the Ignite or Liberty product label.   

Alternatively, Acuron Herbicide may be applied preemergence at a rate down to 2 qt/A as part of a two-pass weed control system when followed by a postemergence application of Ignite or Liberty in ﬁ eld corn designated as LibertyLink. When used in this way, Acuron Herbicide will provide reduced competition of the weeds listed in Table 1 for a period of 30 or more days, thus improving the timing ﬂ exibility and effectiveness of the Ignite or Liberty application. Follow all directions for use and restrictions on the Ignite or Liberty product label.

Environmental Hazards: Do not apply directly to water, to areas where   

surface water is present, or to intertidal areas below the mean high water mark. Do not contaminate water when disposing of equipment wash water or rinsate. This product contains atrazine, which has been shown to be toxic to aquatic invertebrates. Runoff and drift from treated areas may be hazardous to aquatic organisms in neighboring areas. Do not apply when weather conditions favor drift from treated areas.Ground Water Advisory: Acuron Herbicide contains the active ingredi-   

ents atrazine, bicyclopyrone, mesotrione and S-metolachlor.   

Atrazine can travel (seep or leach) through soil and can enter ground water which may be used as drinking water. Atrazine has been found in ground water. Users are advised not to apply atrazine to sand and loamy sand soils where the water table (ground water) is close to the surface and where these soils are very permeable, i.e., well-drained. Your local agricultural agencies can provide further information on the type of soil in your area and the location of ground water.Bicyclopyrone is known to leach through soil into ground water under certain conditions as a result of label use. This chemical may leach into ground water if used in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow.S-metolachlor is known to leach through soil into ground water under   

certain conditions as a result of agricultural use. Use of this product in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow may result in ground water contamination.Surface Water Advisory: This product has a high potential for reaching   

surface water via runoff for several months or more after application. A level, well-maintained vegetative buffer strip between areas to which this product is applied and surface water features such as ponds, streams, and springs will reduce the potential loading of atrazine, bicyclopyrone, mesotrione and S-metolachlor from runoff water and sediment. Runoff   

of this product will be reduced by avoiding applications when rainfall or irrigation is expected to occur within 48 hours.   

Mixing/Loading Instructions: Care must be taken when using this prod-   

uct to prevent back-siphoning into wells, spills, or improper disposal of excess pesticide, spray mixtures, or rinsates.Check valves or antisiphoning devices must be used on mixing equipment.This product must not be mixed/loaded or used within 50 ft of wells, including abandoned wells, drainage wells, and sink holes.*This product must not be mixed or loaded within 50 ft of perennial or intermittent streams and rivers, natural or impounded lakes and reser-voirs. This product may not be applied within 66 ft of the points where ﬁ eld surface water runoff enters perennial or intermittent streams and rivers or within 200 ft from the edge of natural or impounded lakes and reservoirs. If this product is applied to highly erodible land, the 66 ft buffer or setback from runoff entry points must be planted to crop, or seeded with grass or other suitable crop.** For exceptions to these restrictions, see the Environmental Hazards   

section of the Precautionary Statements in attached booklet.   

Tile-Outletted Terraced Fields Containing Standpipes: One of the   

following restrictions must be used in applying atrazine to tile-outletted terraced ﬁ elds containing standpipes:1.  Do not apply this product within 66 ft of standpipes in tile-outletted   

terraced ﬁ elds.   

2.  Apply this product to the entire tile-outletted terraced ﬁ eld and im-   

mediately incorporate it to a depth of 2-3 inches in the entire ﬁ eld.   

3.  Apply this product to the entire tile-outletted terraced ﬁ eld under a   

no-till practice only when a high crop residue management practice is practiced. High crop residue management is described as a crop management practice where little or no crop residue is removed from the ﬁ eld during and after crop harvest.   

Physical and Chemical Hazards: Do not use or store near heat or open   

ﬂ ame.
