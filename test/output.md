DX,FIRE4-19-22AUG13   

## Avoid Static Electricity Risk WhenRefueling   

RG22142—UN—17MAR14   

RG21992—UN—21AUG13The removal of sulfur and other compounds in Ultra-LowSulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuel decreases its conductivity andincreases its ability to store a static charge.   

Refineries may have treated the fuel with a staticdissipating additive. However, there are many factorsthat can reduce the effectiveness of the additive overtime.   

Static charges can build up in ULSD fuel while it isflowing through fuel delivery systems. Static electricitydischarge when combustible vapors are present couldresult in a fire or explosion.   

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the entiresystem used to refuel your machine (fuel supply tank,transfer pump, transfer hose, nozzle, and others) isproperly grounded and bonded. Consult with your fuelor fuel system supplier to ensure that the deliverysystem is in compliance with fueling standards forproper grounding and bonding practices.

The temperature indicator should read in the greenzone during normal operation.   

IMPORTANT: Prevent possible engine damage. Donot shut OFF the engine if the temperaturewarning light comes ON or the bars enter redzone. Shutting OFF the engine causes coolanttemperature to rise even higher, resulting inmachine damage. Reduce the load and run theengine at a slower speed to lower the coolanttemperature. Unless the temperature dropsquickly, stop the engine and determine thecause before resuming operation.   

Watch the temperature gauge closely. If the gaugemoves into the red zone, reduce the load on the engineand determine the cause before resuming operation.

## Reel Position Resume   

Reel Position Resume allows you to select position ofthe reel relative to belts, auger, cutterbar, floor and soforth and return to that position automatically.   

Modify To:   

●   

Harvest standing crop of different heights in thesame field.   

●   

Assist in picking up downed crop.   

●   

Clean off the cutter bar at the end of a cut.   

Set to optimize crop flow:   

●   

Standing Crop (with Height Sensing Active)—position the reel above the cutterbar so that it slightlytouches the grain heads. This helps the crop fall intothe platform.   

In small grain crops, place the reel slightly in front ofthe auger to allow the crop to fall into the auger.Position the reel tines straight down or slightlyforward. If the crop starts to turn with the reel, the reelposition setting is too low. If you see crop being hit bythe reel and bouncing back and forth before beingcut, reduce the reel speed. Too fast of a reel speedwill result in header losses.   

Header Application   

## 45-C-23   

●   

Down Crop (with Float Mode Active)— place thereel in front of the cutterbar so that the reel can rakeup the crop. Position the reel tines backward to helpwith lifting the crop. Consider the use of crop lifters ifthey are available for your platform type.   

●   

Headland Turns (with Height Resume Active)—position the reel as close as possible to the cutterbar.This prevents crop from falling out of the platformduring a headland turn.

Increase Sieve Clearance To:   

●   

Reduce amount of free grain in the tailings; allowsmore grain to fall through to clean grain soonerbefore it is recirculated in tailings.   

●   

Increase cleaning fan air flow; increasing sieveclearance allows more cleaning fan air up throughthe chaffer.   

NOTE: Opening of the sieve will also decrease pressurein the cleaning shoe. Large adjustments couldrequire readjustment of the fan speed.   

Decrease Sieve Clearance To:   

●   

Improve sample quality; reduce the amount of foreignmaterial in the grain tank.   

NOTE: To find the optimal setting for low tailings, highcapacity, and grain tank cleanliness, increase sieveclearance until you see a dirty grain tank. Then,decrease sieve clearance until dirt disappears.

Modify When:   

●   

Changing crop type.   

●   

Harvesting conditions vary (wet crop versus dry crop,high moisture versus low moisture, variety A versusvariety B, or large swings in seed size or yield).   

NOTE: It is not necessary to set a new target if you areusing a recent performance target for this crop typeand harvesting conditions.   

Procedure to Modify:   

NOTE: Larger seed sizes, such as corn or soybeans,generally have a lower numerical calibration valuethan smaller seed sizes, such as wheat or canola.

Total Loss Indicator   

NOTE: Total Loss Indicator bar graph is now a visualguide. You can refer to the corner post displayperiodically to know when an increase or decreasein the total loss amount occurs.   

If the total loss indicator bar graph is above orbelow the green area and losses are acceptable,the grain loss monitor is either incorrectly adjustedor there is a higher flow of material through themachine since the grain loss monitor was lastcalibrated. Higher flow of material can be caused byincreased ground speed or higher crop yields.   

When the machine encounters a “slug”, the middlebar graph will fluctuate upward (15 to 20 seconds)and then return to the previous reading. Ignorethese fluctuations when this occurs.

## Parked Filter Cleaning   

Parked Filter Cleaning is a process which you initiate toclean the exhaust filter when required.   

During the process, engine speed is controlled by thesystem, and the machine must remain parked tocomplete the procedure. Time required for the ParkedFilter Cleaning process is dependent upon the level ofexhaust filter restriction, ambient temperatures, andcurrent exhaust gas temperature.   

Procedure to Modify:   

CAUTION: When AUTO or PARKED cleaning isenabled, the exhaust temperature can be highunder no load or light load conditions at certaintimes during the exhaust filter cleaning cycle.   

Servicing machine or attachments during theexhaust filter cleaning can result in seriouspersonal injury. Avoid exposure and skincontact with hot exhaust gases andcomponents.   

During auto or manual/stationary exhaust filtercleaning operations, the engine runs atelevated idle and hot temperatures for anextended period. Exhaust gases and exhaustfilter components reach temperatures hotenough to burn people, or ignite, or meltcommon materials.

NOTE: A sample is not a complete grain tank.Recording of a sample starts when theActiveYield

sensors are fully covered with grainand stops at about 3000 kg (6614 lbs). A samplecan be rejected in the following conditions:   

Inconsistent Flow— the mass flow variation was toolarge to generate acceptable calibration load.   

Uneven Loading/Grain Pile Shift Detected— graintank loading was not within the parameters to generatean accepted calibration load. This could be due toexcessive grain shifts in the grain tank caused by quickacceleration/deceleration of the machine or travellingover rough terrain.   

Pitch or Roll Too Large— if the pitch or roll angle of themachine was larger than 4° during sample collection,the load will be rejected.   

Collection Interrupted— if harvesting stopped or theunloading auger was engaged while sample collectionwas in progress, the load will be rejected.   

400 Seconds Exceeded— a load will be rejected if ithas not reached its minimum load size after 400seconds (6 minutes and 40 seconds).   

Mass Flow Vibration Calibration Not Conducted—not performing the mass flow vibration calibration cantrigger inconsistent flow conditions or cause the massflow to not be detected at all. A load can be rejected orwill not start to be recorded.

## | Calibration Correction   

Calibration Correction allows you to fix discrepancies in   

the ActiveYield   

™   

calculated yield values between twoor more machines operating in the same field.   

Adjust the offset correction when one machine iscalculating yield values more accurately than the othermachines when checked by a scale. Do not adjust theoffset correction unless there is more than 4% error inthe yield values between the most accurate machineand the other machine or machines.   

NOTE: The offset correction is only valid until the nextaccepted load is collected. ActiveYield   

™   

adjuststhe yield calibration as more loads are accepted.   

Procedure to Determine Offset Correction:   

IMPORTANT: Do not adjust the correction value withless than 15 accepted samples completed.   

1. Harvest at least 15 accepted samples at a consistentmoisture and ground speed.   

2. Harvest and scale-check 5 full grain tank loads.Compare the wet weight of each load to themeasured scale weight for the same load.

Modify When:   

●   

You want to set the maximum operating speed.   

●   

You do not want the machine running over a specificspeed because the terrain is rough or feedingconditions exist that could plug the header.   

Example: The header becomes limited at 8 km/h (5mph). Set ground speed to 7.5 km/h (4.7 mph).   

●   

You want to prevent the machine from going too fastthrough places in the field where there is little to nocrop. This results in the machine going too fast whencrop yields return to normal. Set the speed limitslightly higher than the expected harvesting speed.   

Example: You expect to harvest at an averagespeed of 5.5 km/h (3.4 mph). Set the ground speed to7 km/h (4.3 mph).

## Chaffer Adjust   

Chaffer Adjust allows you to modify the opening of thechaffer elements to improve the grain cleanliness andreduce the cleaning shoe loss for varying crops andconditions.   

NOTE: For the chaffer clearance settings, refer to CropSettings section in your Operator's Manual.   

Modify When:   

Increase Chaffer Clearance To:   

●   

Reduce cleaning shoe loss by allowing the grain tofall through sooner before it can escape the cleaningshoe.   

●   

Allow the grain to fall through sooner before it isforced into the tailings.   

Decrease Chaffer Clearance To:   

●   

Improve sample quality by reducing the amount oflarger, foreign material in the grain tank.

CAUTION: Raise the feeder house, engage thefeeder house safety lock, shut OFF engine, setpark brake, and remove key.   

NOTE: See the Crop Settings section for recommendedfeeder house conveyor sprocket settings.   

Important notes about 22-tooth sprocket:   

●   

Sprocket is not recommended for corn use.   

Recommended when poor feeding occurs in thefollowing crops and conditions:   

●   

Crops: Barley, Canola, Oats, Rye, and Wheat   

●   

Conditions: High Volume, Green, Wet, Windrowed,and Poor Feeding   

As crop conditions change or feeding improves (dryer,more even windrows, lighter straw), it is recommendedto use the 18-tooth sprocket. Chain speed slows andreduces potential for straw damage or pre-threshing andextends chain life.   

Feeder conveyor chain can be set to two differentspeeds by selecting drive sprocket (A) on the right-handside of the lower shaft.

If tines or elements need to be removed forreasons other than replacement, mark locationon tines/elements and rotor prior to removal.Install in same location as removed to maintainbalance. Always use new cap screws.   

Make sure to clean out tailings and front crossauger if tine replacement is due to broken ordamaged tines. Failure to do so before initialstart-up may allow broken tines to recirculateand cause tine damage to reoccur.   

1. Shut OFF engine, set park brake, and remove key.   

2. Remove separator grates or concave sections asneeded to access rotor.   

3. Inspect wear on threshing elements and separatortines.

## Flat-Tooth Comb Chaffer 30 mm (1-3/16 in)   

H125454—UN—06DEC18   

NOTE: Dimension shown is wire-to-wire spacing.   

The flat-tooth comb chaffer requires a 2—3 mmwider chaffer clearance opening and 50 rpm higherfan speed compared to the general-purposechaffer.   

The flat-tooth comb chaffer improves tailings volumeand grain tank sample, especially in challengingconditions (weedy conditions and heavily beardedcrops), such as canola, oil seed (rape), and lentils. Thecurled chaffer finger reduces the amount of longer stickspassing through the chaffer.

## Service Tires Safely   

TS211—UN—15APR13   

CAUTION: Explosive separation of a tire andrim parts can cause serious injury or death.   

Do not attempt to mount a tire unless you havethe proper equipment and experience toperform the job.   

Always maintain the correct tire pressure. Do not inflatethe tires above the recommended pressure.   

Never weld or heat a wheel and tire assembly. The heatcan cause an increase in air pressure resulting in a tireexplosion. Welding can structurally weaken or deformthe wheel.   

When inflating tires, use a clip-on chuck and extensionhose long enough to allow you to stand to one side andNOT in front of or over the tire assembly. Use a safetycage if available.   

Check wheels for low pressure, cuts, bubbles, damagedrims or missing lug bolts and nuts.

## Care and Service of Tires   

IMPORTANT: Installing tires that do not meetoriginal equipment tire specifications maycause machine malfunction. Consult yourdealer or tire supplier for guidance.   

Use of substandard tires or larger thanrecommended tires will void warranty and maydecrease stability, affect steering, result inpremature tire failure, or cause other durabilityor safety issues.   

Check tires daily for damage or noticeably low pressure.   

At least every 100 hours of operation, check tirepressure. If tires contain liquid ballast, use a special air-water gauge and measure with valve stem at bottom.   

A small puncture in a tubeless tire can be temporarilyrepaired without dismounting the tire, thus avoidingdown time during a busy season.   

Protect tires from exposure to sunlight, petroleumproducts, and chemicals.   

Drive carefully. Try to avoid rocks and sharp objects.   

IMPORTANT: A permanent repair should be made assoon as possible to prevent further tire damage.   

NOTE: Tire information and specifications are based onthe latest information available at the time ofpublication. The right is reserved to make changesat any time without notice. See the online CombineAg Sales Manual or your John Deere dealer forfurther information on Tire Pressure Charts.   

Tire pressures listed in charts may differ from thetire pressures shown on the side of the tires.   

## Ground Drive and Rear Axle   

## 85-1   

Header compatibility and specified inflationpressures are based on front axle load of a coarsegrain configuration.

## Using Liquid Weight   

H128746—UN—31JAN20   

CAUTION: Installing liquid weight (ballast)requires special equipment and training.   

IMPORTANT: Cover rim completely with solution toavoid corrosion, but NEVER fill any tire morethan 90% full. More solution would leave toolittle air space to absorb shocks. Damage to tirecould occur.   

A solution of water and calcium chloride provides a safeand economical ballast. Used properly, it will notdamage tires, tubes, or rims.   

Use calcium chloride to prevent water from freezing. Amixture of 1.6 kg (3-1/2 lb) of calcium chloride per 3.8 L(1 gal) will not freeze solid above -45°C (-50°F).   

NOTE: Use of alcohol as liquid ballast is notrecommended. Calcium chloride solution is heavierand more economical.   

Fill tubeless tires at least to valve level (minimum 75%full). Less solution would expose part of rim, possiblycausing corrosion. Tube-type tires may be filled to anylevel below 90%.

## Operation at Low Temperatures   

IMPORTANT: When operating in cold temperatures,verify that proper grade diesel fuel is beingused. Warmer grade diesel fuel will gel in fuellines, fuel filters, and fuel tank. Fuel systemrequires servicing if diesel fuel gels. See Fuelsand Lubricants section for further information.   

Combine functions can degrade in low temperatureswhere snow and ice are present. Special care MUST betaken to ensure that minimal snow is ingested incombine. If snow is ingested, areas such as chaffer,cleaning fan, separator concaves, and separator gratescan become obstructed. Operation with these areasobstructed could cause machine damage andsignificant repairs or result in functional performancedegradation. Consult your John Deere dealer prior tooperating in cold temperatures.   

OUO6075,0004574-19-31JAN17   

## Harvesting Tips   

Adjust machine to crop being harvested and to fieldconditions.   

Select a ground speed that does not overload machine.Engine must be at full rpm to keep separator at fullspeed. Select a ground speed for slower travel, but donot slow engine speed.   

If the concave is set too close for the harvested crop,straw will be excessively ground up requiring morehorsepower to thresh the crop.   

If the concave is set too wide for the harvested crop, itwill not be completely threshed.   

After threshing clearance is adjusted properly, adjustseparator speed to achieve maximum threshing with theleast amount of crop damage. If crop damage doesoccur, reduce feed accelerator speed. Threshingclearance in these crops has very little effect on seeddamage.   

Crops such as edible beans and peas are easilycracked and can require the use of a slower feedaccelerator drive. When harvesting edible beans andpeas keep machine full to provide enough material tocushion the crop against cracking.   

For potential improvements in straw quality considerthat the following can help improve straw qualitydepending on conditions:   

●   

Slowing feeder house chain speed   

●   

Slowing feed accelerator speed   

●   

Slowing rotor speed   

●   

Opening concave   

●   

Reducing threshing elements   

●   

Installing round bar concaves   

For improved performance in sidehill conditions,consider trying the following:   

●   

Adjust the position of the angled dividers on the frontstep pan to improve shoe distribution.   

●   

Install tall chaffer dividers (available from your JohnDeere dealer).   

●   

Install separator grate covers (if equipped) toimprove the chaff and grain distribution.   

Each of these actions can improve the chaff and graindistribution to the cleaning shoe, resulting in improvedperformance in sidehill conditions.   

When using a cutting platform, cut crop as high aspossible without loss of low heads. Adjust reel positionand speed for even feeding. Keep cutterbar in registerand guards in alignment for clean cutting.   

When harvesting corn, keep corn head only as low asnecessary for ears. Keep it centered in the rows toprevent ear loss.   

When using a belt pickup, keep windrow centered somaterial is fed evenly into the feeder house. Grainheads must be lying in one direction. Operate machineso heads are picked up first.   

When harvesting soybeans with a row-crop head, keepheader as low as possible. When harvesting crops suchas milo or sunflowers, operate header just low enoughto cut the heads from the stalks.   

Adjust chaffer openings to pass grain or seed to thelower sieve in the first two-thirds of the chaffer withoutadmitting too much coarse material.   

Use as much air as possible without blowing over cleangrain and seed. Heavy crops require more air than lightseed crops.

NOTE: Varying machine ground speed is the best wayto vary the flow rate.   

The best way to keep the flow rate constant is tomonitor the VisionTrak

display and adjustmachine ground speed accordingly.   

## Single Point Yield Calibration   

Single point yield calibration is performed when one orup to three calibration loads are collected.   

This type of calibration is suggested when the harvestedfield has a fairly consistent yield and machine isoperated at a constant ground speed with little flowvariation.   

To collect a calibration load, harvest approximately 2722kg (6000 lb) at the maximum harvest speed.   

Running one or two additional loads is not required, butit may allow the system to average the overall error.   

## Multi-Point Yield Calibration   

Multi-point yield calibration is used when the harvestedfield is expected to have varying yields or machine isoperated at varying speeds with varying grain flows.   

This type of calibration collects each calibration load ateach expected flow condition.   

For each calibration load, harvest approximately 2722kg (6000 lb).   

Run at least four calibration loads over various groundspeeds (A—D) or at different cut widths to simulate fourdifferent flow rates (E—H).

## Power Shutdown Procedure   

NOTE: A power shutdown is used to determine themachine’s performance in the threshing andseparating areas by taking a "snapshot" of thematerial in the separator. This is valuable indetermining where the losses behind the machineare generated and what adjustments can be madeto correct the condition.   

Verify that crop condition and material intake issimilar for each shutdown.   

1.   

Locate engine speed indicator on corner postdisplay and threshing speed readout on armrestdisplay.   

2.   

Lock brake pedals together.   

3.   

Operate machine at optimized throughput levels inthe desired crop.   

4.   

Move steering wheel forward for free motion (bothhands needed).   

5.   

Press low idle engine speed switch on armrest.   

NOTE: The machine is designed to have a slower drawdown of the engine rpm and more of a run-on forseparator components.   

6.   

Lightly depress brake pedals (machine attempts torepower and downshifts changing the machinedynamics if brakes are fully depressed).   

H128739—UN—31JAN20   

Header Engage Switch/Separator Engage Switch   

7.   

As engine speed drops and nears low idle speed(1200 rpm), quickly disengage header engageswitch and separator engage switch on armrest.   

8.   

Quickly move the multi-function lever to neutralposition.   

9.   

Allow engine to cool for a minute.   

H127222—UN—26SEP19   

Key Switch   

10. Turn key switch to shut OFF engine, set park brake,and remove key.   

11. Inspect for excessive grain damage, kernels left onthe cobs, uneven distribution of material on thereturn pan and cleaning shoe, and free grain lossbefore making any adjustments.   

12. Decide what adjustments are needed. Openthreshing clearance and engage separator (avoidsundue stress to cylinder drive area during cleanout).   

13. Adjust machine to desired settings and continueharvesting.   

14. Repeat this procedure and verify grain quality andlosses behind machine.   

15. Once acceptable loss levels are attained, calibrateVisionTrak

## General Cleaning Guidelines   

Machine must be inspected periodically throughout theharvest day. Buildup of crop material and other debrismust be removed to ensure proper machine functionand to reduce the risk of fire. Frequency of inspectionsand cleanings vary depending on a number of factors,including operating conditions, machine settings, cropconditions, operating speeds, and weather conditions.Inspections and cleanings may be required multipletimes throughout the harvest day, particularly in dry, hot,and windy conditions. Wet crop conditions can alsopose a fire risk under some circumstances.   

IMPORTANT: Regular and thorough cleaning ofmachine combined with other routinemaintenance procedures listed in theOperator’s Manual greatly reduce the risk offire, chance of costly downtime, and improvemachine performance.   

Crop material and other debris can accumulatein various areas. Direction of wind, type of crop,and crop moisture content can all impact whereand how much crop material and debris canaccumulate. Be aware of harvest conditionsand adjust your cleaning schedule to ensureproper machine function and to reduce the riskof fire. Inspect and clean these areas as neededthroughout the harvest day.   

Harvesting certain crops can cause special issues.Some crops are very “sticky” and it is often more difficultto clean the machine when harvesting these crops.Examples of these crops include, but are not limited tosunflower, canola, and safflower. Take special care incleaning the machine when harvesting these types ofcrops.   

Always follow all safety procedures posted on themachine and in the Operator’s Manual. Before carryingout any inspection or cleaning, always shut OFF engine,set park brake, and remove key.

## Cleaning Out Machine (Periodic Cleanout)   

The photographs in this section show areas of themachine that require regular inspection and cleaning.While there are other areas that require regularcleaning, frequent attention to these areas provides thegreatest impact on fire prevention.   

Some of these photographs show accumulations of cropmaterial and other debris prior to cleaning. This type ofaccumulation is not normal; it was allowed for illustrativepurposes only.   

IMPORTANT: These areas may require morefrequent cleaning, even multiple times per day,depending on harvest conditions. Be aware ofharvest conditions and adjust your cleaningschedule to ensure proper machine functionand to reduce the risk of fire.   

Other areas not covered in this section mayalso collect crop debris and MUST be cleanedperiodically for machine function andappearance. Thoroughly inspect the entiremachine on a regular basis throughout theharvest season.   

Before carrying out any inspection or cleaning, alwaysshut OFF engine, set park brake, and remove key.   

Thoroughly clean machine from top to bottom withcompressed air. First, clean all areas accessible fromthe engine deck. Panels or covers may need to beremoved or opened to access areas for cleaning. Startwith engine compartment and work outwards andcounterclockwise to other areas around enginecompartment, floor underneath engine, top rear of rotor,and rear deck, including areas around exhaustaftertreatment enclosure (if equipped). Once top areasof machine are clean, proceed to cleaning areasaccessible from the ground level.   

From the ground level, clean rear underside of fuel tankarea and top of the rear tailboard of the residue disposalsystem. Once the cleaning from the ground level isfinished, recheck engine compartment for any cropdebris that could have blown in from the ground levelcleaning.

TS202—UN—23AUG88Handle fuel with care: it is highly flammable. Do notrefuel the machine while smoking or when near openflame or sparks.   

Always stop engine before refueling machine. Fill fueltank outdoors.   

Prevent fires by keeping machine clean of accumulatedtrash, grease, and debris. Always clean up spilled fuel.   

Use only an approved fuel container for transportingflammable liquids.   

Never fill fuel container in pickup truck with plastic bedliner. Always place fuel container on ground beforerefueling. Touch fuel container with fuel dispensernozzle before removing can lid. Keep fuel dispensernozzle in contact with fuel container inlet when filling.   

Do not store fuel container where there is an openflame, spark, or pilot light such as within a water heateror other appliance.

## Avoid Static Electricity Risk WhenRefueling   

RG22142—UN—17MAR14   

RG21992—UN—21AUG13The removal of sulfur and other compounds in Ultra-LowSulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuel decreases its conductivity andincreases its ability to store a static charge.   

Refineries may have treated the fuel with a staticdissipating additive. However, there are many factorsthat can reduce the effectiveness of the additive overtime.   

Static charges can build up in ULSD fuel while it isflowing through fuel delivery systems. Static electricitydischarge when combustible vapors are present couldresult in a fire or explosion.   

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the entiresystem used to refuel your machine (fuel supply tank,transfer pump, transfer hose, nozzle, and others) isproperly grounded and bonded. Consult with your fuelor fuel system supplier to ensure that the deliverysystem is in compliance with fueling standards forproper grounding and bonding practices.

## Handling and Storing Diesel Fuel   

CAUTION: Reduce the risk of fire. Handle fuelcarefully. DO NOT fill the fuel tank when engineis running. DO NOT smoke while you fill the fueltank or service the fuel system.   

Fill the fuel tank at the end of each day's operation toprevent water condensation and freezing during coldweather.   

Keep all storage tanks as full as practicable to minimizecondensation.   

Ensure that all fuel tank caps and covers are installedproperly to prevent moisture from entering. Monitorwater content of the fuel regularly.   

When using BioDiesel fuel, the fuel filter may requiremore frequent replacement due to premature plugging.   

Check engine oil level daily prior to starting engine. Arising oil level may indicate fuel dilution of the engine oil.   

When fuel is stored for an extended period or if there isa slow turnover of fuel, add a fuel conditioner to stabilizethe fuel and prevent water condensation. Contact your   

fuel supplier or John Deere dealer forrecommendations.   

OUO6075,000163E-19-06SEP13   

## Diesel Fuel   

Consult your local fuel distributor for properties of thediesel fuel available in your area.   

In general, diesel fuels are blended to satisfy the lowtemperature requirements of the geographical area inwhich they are marketed.   

Diesel fuels specified to EN 590 or ASTM D975 arerecommended. Renewable diesel fuel produced byhydrotreating animal fats and vegetable oils is basicallyidentical to petroleum diesel fuel. Renewable diesel thatmeets EN 590, ASTM D975, or EN 15940 is acceptablefor use at all percentage mixture levels.   

## Required Fuel Properties   

In all cases, the fuel shall meet the following properties:   

Cetane number of 40 minimum. Cetane numbergreater than 47 is preferred, especially for temperaturesbelow –20 °C (–4 °F) or elevations above 1675 m (5500ft.).   

Cloud Point should be below the expected lowestambient temperature or Cold Filter Plugging Point   

(CFPP) should be a maximum 10°C (18°F) below thefuel cloud point.   

Fuel lubricity should pass a maximum scar diameter of0.52 mm as measured by ASTM D6079 or ISO 12156-1.A maximum scar diameter of 0.45 mm is preferred.   

Diesel fuel quality and sulfur content must complywith all existing emissions regulations for the area inwhich the engine operates. DO NOT use diesel fuel withsulfur content greater than 10 000 mg/kg (10 000 ppm).   

Materials such as copper, lead, zinc, tin, brass andbronze should be avoided in fuel handling, distributionand storage equipment as these metals can catalyzefuel oxidation reactions which can lead to fuel systemdeposits and plugged fuel filters.   

## E-Diesel fuel   

DO NOT use E-Diesel (Diesel fuel and ethanol blend).Use of E-Diesel fuel in any John Deere machine mayvoid the machine warranty.   

CAUTION: Avoid severe injury or death due tothe fire and explosion risk from using E-Dieselfuel.   

## Sulfur Content for Interim Tier 4, Final Tier 4, StageIII A and B, Stage IV, and Stage V Engines Above 560kW   

●   

Use ONLY diesel fuel with a maximum of 500 mg/kg(500 ppm) sulfur content.   

Fuels and Lubricants   

## 115-3   

## Sulfur Content for Interim Tier 4, Final Tier 4, StageIII B, Stage IV Engines, and Stage V Engines   

●   

Use ONLY ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel with amaximum of 15 mg/kg (15 ppm) sulfur content.   

## Sulfur Content for Tier 3 and Stage III A Engines   

●   

Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 1000mg/kg (1000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.   

●   

Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content 1000—2000mg/kg (1000—2000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filterchange interval.   

●   

BEFORE using diesel fuel with sulfur content greaterthan 2000 mg/kg (2000 ppm), contact your JohnDeere dealer.   

## Sulfur Content for Tier 2 and Stage II Engines   

●   

Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 2000mg/kg (2000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.   

●   

Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content 2000—5000mg/kg (2000—5000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filterchange interval.1   

●   

BEFORE using diesel fuel with sulfur content greaterthan 5000 mg/kg (5000 ppm), contact your JohnDeere dealer.   

## Sulfur Content for Other Engines   

●   

Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 5000mg/kg (5000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.   

●   

Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than5000 mg/kg (5000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filterchange interval.   

IMPORTANT: Do not mix used diesel engine oil orany other type of lubricating oil with diesel fuel.   

Improper fuel additive usage may causedamage on fuel injection equipment of dieselengines.   

DX,FUEL1-19-13JUL20   

## Biodiesel Fuel   

Biodiesel fuel is comprised of monoalkyl esters of longchain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animalfats. Biodiesel blends are biodiesel mixed withpetroleum diesel fuel on a volume basis.   

Before using fuel containing biodiesel, review theBiodiesel Use Requirements and Recommendations inthis Operator’s Manual.   

Environmental laws and regulations can encourage orprohibit the use of biofuels. Operators should consult   

with appropriate governmental authorities prior to usingbiofuels.   

## John Deere Stage V Engines Operating in theEuropean Union   

Where the engine is to be operated within the Union ondiesel or non-road gas-oil, a fuel with a FAME contentnot greater than 8% volume/volume (B8) shall be used.   

## John Deere Engines with Exhaust Filter ExceptStage V Engines Operating in the European Union   

Biodiesel blends up to B20 can be used ONLY if thebiodiesel (100% biodiesel or B100) meets ASTMD6751, EN 14214, or equivalent specification. Expect a2% reduction in power and a 3% reduction in fueleconomy when using B20.   

Biodiesel concentrations above B20 can harm theengine’s emission control systems and should not beused. Risks include, but are not limited to, morefrequent stationary regeneration, soot accumulation,and increased intervals for ash removal.   

John Deere Fuel conditioners or equivalent, whichcontain detergent and dispersant additives, are requiredwhen using biodiesel blends from B10 to B20, and arerecommended when using lower biodiesel blends.   

## John Deere Engines Without Exhaust Filter   

Biodiesel blends up to B20 can be used ONLY if thebiodiesel (100% biodiesel or B100) meets ASTMD6751, EN 14214, or equivalent specification. Expect a2% reduction in power and a 3% reduction in fueleconomy when using B20.   

These John Deere engines can operate on biodieselblends above B20 (up to 100% biodiesel). Operate atlevels above B20 ONLY if the biodiesel is permitted bylaw and meets the EN 14214 specification (primarilyavailable in Europe). Engines operating on biodieselblends above B20 might not fully comply with or bepermitted by all applicable emissions regulations.Expect up to a 12% reduction in power and an 18%reduction in fuel economy when using 100% biodiesel.   

John Deere fuel conditioners or equivalent, whichcontain detergent and dispersant additives, are requiredwhen using biodiesel blends from B10 to B100, and arerecommended when using lower biodiesel blends.   

## Biodiesel Use Requirements and Recommendations   

The petroleum diesel portion of all biodiesel blendsmust meet the requirements of ASTM D975 (US) or EN590 (EU) commercial standard.   

Biodiesel users in the U.S. are strongly encouraged topurchase biodiesel blends from a BQ-9000 CertifiedMarketer and sourced from a BQ-9000 AccreditedProducer (as certified by the National biodiesel Board).Certified Marketers and Accredited Producers can befound at the following website: http://www.bq9000.org.   

Biodiesel contains residual ash. Ash levels exceeding

Fuels and Lubricants   

## 115-4   

the maximums allowed in either ASTM D6751 orEN14214 can result in more rapid ash loading andrequire more frequent cleaning of the Exhaust Filter (ifpresent).   

The fuel filter can require more frequent replacementwhen using biodiesel fuel, particularly if switching fromdiesel. Check engine oil level daily prior to startingengine. A rising oil level can indicate fuel dilution of theengine oil. Biodiesel blends up to B20 must be usedwithin 90 days of the date of biodiesel manufacture.Biodiesel blends above B20 must be used within 45days from the date of biodiesel manufacture.   

When using biodiesel blends up to B20, the followingmust be considered:   

●   

Cold-weather flow degradation   

●   

Stability and storage issues (moisture absorption,microbial growth)   

●   

Possible filter restriction and plugging (usually aproblem when first switching to biodiesel on usedengines)   

●   

Possible fuel leakage through seals and hoses(primarily an issue with older engines)   

●   

Possible reduction of service life of enginecomponents   

Request a certificate of analysis from your fueldistributor to ensure that the fuel is compliant with thespecifications provided in this Operator’s Manual.   

Consult your John Deere dealer for John Deere fuelproducts to improve storage and performance withbiodiesel fuels.   

The following must also be considered if using biodieselblends above B20:   

●   

Possible coking or blocked injector nozzles, resultingin power loss and engine misfire if John Deere fueladditives and conditioners or equivalent containingdetergent/dispersants are not used   

●   

Possible crankcase oil dilution (requiring morefrequent oil changes)   

●   

Possible lacquering or seizure of internalcomponents   

●   

Possible formation of sludge and sediments   

●   

Possible thermal oxidation of fuel at elevatedtemperatures   

●   

Possible compatibility issues with other materials(including copper, lead, zinc, tin, brass, and bronze)used in fuel handling, distribution, and storageequipment   

●   

Possible reduction in water separator efficiency   

●   

Possible damage to paint if exposed to biodiesel   

●   

Possible corrosion of fuel injection equipment   

●   

Possible elastomeric seal and gasket materialdegradation (primarily an issue with older engines)   

●   

Possible high acid levels within fuel system   

●   

Because biodiesel blends above B20 contain moreash, using blends above B20 can result in more rapidash loading and require more frequent cleaning ofthe Exhaust Filter (if present)   

IMPORTANT: Raw pressed vegetable oils are NOTacceptable for use as fuel in any concentrationin John Deere engines. Their use could causeengine failure.   

DX,FUEL7-19-13JAN18   

## Lubricity of Diesel Fuel   

Most diesel fuels manufactured in the United States,Canada, and the European Union have adequatelubricity to ensure proper operation and durability of fuelinjection system components. However, diesel fuelsmanufactured in some areas of the world may lack thenecessary lubricity.   

IMPORTANT: Make sure the diesel fuel used in yourmachine demonstrates good lubricitycharacteristics.   

Fuel lubricity should pass a maximum scar diameter of0.52 mm as measured by ASTM D6079 or ISO 12156-1.A maximum scar diameter of 0.45 mm is preferred.   

If fuel of low or unknown lubricity is used, add JohnDeere Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (orequivalent) at the specified concentration.   

## Lubricity of BioDiesel Fuel   

Fuel lubricity can improve significantly with BioDieselblends up to B20 (20% BioDiesel). Further increase inlubricity is limited for BioDiesel blends greater than B20.   

DX,FUEL5-19-07FEB14   

## Supplemental Diesel Fuel Additives   

Diesel fuel can be the source of performance or otheroperational problems for many reasons. Some causesinclude poor lubricity, contaminants, low cetane number,and a variety of properties that cause fuel systemdeposits. These and others are referenced in othersections of this Operator's Manual.   

To optimize engine performance and reliability, closelyfollow recommendations on fuel quality, storage, andhandling, which are found elsewhere in this Operator'sManual.   

To further aid in maintaining performance and reliabilityof the engine's fuel system, John Deere has developeda family of fuel additive products for most globalmarkets. The primary products include Fuel-ProtectDiesel Fuel Conditioner (full feature conditioner in winterand summer formulas) and Fuel-Protect Keep Clean

DX,FUEL13-19-07FEB14   

## Testing Diesel Fuel   

A fuel analysis program can help to monitor the qualityof diesel fuel. The fuel analysis can provide critical datasuch as calculated cetane index, fuel type, sulfurcontent, water content, appearance, suitability for coldweather operations, bacteria, cloud point, acid number,particulate contamination, and whether the fuel meetsASTM D975 or equivalent specification.   

Contact your John Deere dealer for more information ondiesel fuel analysis.

## Minimizing the Effect of Cold Weather onDiesel Engines   

John Deere diesel engines are designed to operateeffectively in cold weather.   

However, for effective starting and cold-weatheroperation, a little extra care is necessary. The followinginformation outlines steps that can minimize the effectthat cold weather may have on starting and operation ofyour engine. See your John Deere dealer for additionalinformation and local availability of cold-weather aids.   

## Use Winter Grade Fuel   

When temperatures fall below 0°C (32°F), winter gradefuel (No. 1-D in North America) is best suited for cold-weather operation. Winter grade fuel has a lower cloudpoint and a lower pour point.   

Cloud point is the temperature at which wax begins toform in the fuel. This wax causes fuel filters to plug.   

Pour point is the lowest temperature at whichmovement of the fuel is observed.   

NOTE: On average, winter grade diesel fuel has a lowerBtu (heat content) rating. Using winter grade fuelmay reduce power and fuel efficiency, but shouldnot cause any other engine performance effects.Check the grade of fuel being used beforetroubleshooting for low-power complaints in cold-weather operation.   

## Air Intake Heater   

An air intake heater is an available option for someengines to aid cold weather starting.   

## Ether   

An ether port on the intake is available to aid coldweather starting.   

CAUTION: Ether is highly flammable. Do notuse ether when starting an engine equippedwith glow plugs or an air intake heater.   

## Coolant Heater   

An engine block heater (coolant heater) is an availableoption to aid cold weather starting.   

## Seasonal Viscosity Oil and Proper CoolantConcentration   

Use seasonal grade viscosity engine oil based on theexpected air temperature range between oil changesand a proper concentration of low silicate antifreeze asrecommended. (See DIESEL ENGINE OIL andENGINE COOLANT requirements in this section.)   

## Diesel Fuel Cold Flow Additive   

Use John Deere Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner(winter formula), which contains anti-gel chemistry, orequivalent fuel conditioner to treat non-winter grade fuel(No. 2-D in North America) during the cold-weatherseason. This generally extends operability to about 10°C (18°F) below the fuel cloud point. For operability ateven lower temperatures, use winter grade fuel.   

IMPORTANT: Treat fuel when outside temperaturedrops below 0°C (32°F). For best results, usewith untreated fuel. Follow all recommendedinstructions on label.   

## Biodiesel   

When operating with biodiesel blends, wax formationcan occur at warmer temperatures. Begin using JohnDeere Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (winterformula) or equivalent at 5°C (41°F) to treat biodieselfuels during the cold-weather season. Use B5 or lowerblends at temperatures below 0°C (32°F). Use onlywinter grade petroleum diesel fuel at temperaturesbelow -10°C (14°F).   

## Winterfronts   

Use of fabric, cardboard, or solid winterfronts is notrecommended with any John Deere engine. Their usecan result in excessive engine coolant, oil, and chargeair temperatures. This can lead to reduced engine life,loss of power and poor fuel economy. Winterfronts mayalso put abnormal stress on fan and fan drivecomponents potentially causing premature failures.   

If winterfronts are used, they should never totally closeoff the grill frontal area. Approximately 25% area in thecenter of the grill should remain open at all times. At notime should the air blockage device be applied directlyto the radiator core.   

Fuels and Lubricants   

## 115-6   

## Radiator Shutters   

If equipped with a thermostatically controlled radiatorshutter system, this system should be regulated in sucha way that the shutters are completely open by the timethe coolant reaches 93°C (200°F) to prevent excessiveintake manifold temperatures. Manually controlledsystems are not recommended.   

If air-to-air aftercooling is used, the shutters must becompletely open by the time the intake manifold airtemperature reaches the maximum allowabletemperature out of the charge air cooler.   

For more information, see your John Deere dealer.

## Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) — Use inSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)Equipped Engines   

In order to maintain the emissions performance of theengine, it is essential to use and refill DEF inaccordance with the specification.   

Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is a high purity liquid that isinjected into the exhaust system of engines equippedwith selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems.Maintaining the purity of DEF is important to avoidmalfunctions in the SCR system. Engines requiring DEFshall use a product that meets the requirements foraqueous urea solution 32 (AUS 32) according to ISO22241-1.   

The use of John Deere Diesel Exhaust Fluid isrecommended. John Deere Diesel Exhaust Fluid isavailable at your John Deere dealer in a variety ofpackage sizes to suit your operational needs.   

If John Deere Diesel Exhaust Fluid is not available, useDEF that is certified by the American Petroleum Institute(API) Diesel Exhaust Fluid Certification Program or bythe AdBlue

## Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF)   

IMPORTANT: Using DEF with the correctconcentration is critical to engine andaftertreatment system performance. Extendedstorage and other conditions can adverselyalter the DEF concentration.   

If DEF quality is questionable, draw a sample out of theDEF tank or storage tank into a clear container. DEFmust be crystal clear with a light ammonia smell. If DEFappears cloudy, has a colored tint, or has a profoundammonia smell, it is likely not within specification. DEFin this condition should not be used. Drain tank, flushwith distilled water and refill with new or good DEF. Afterrefilling the tank, check the DEF concentration.   

If the DEF passes the visual and smell test, check theDEF concentration with a handheld refractometercalibrated to measure DEF.   

DEF concentration should be checked when the enginehas been stored for extended periods, or if there issuspicion the engine or packaged DEF fluid has beencontaminated with water.   

Two approved tools are available through your JohnDeere dealer:   

●   

JDG11594 Digital DEF Refractometer—A digital toolproviding an easy to read concentrationmeasurement   

●   

JDG11684 DEF Refractometer—Low-costalternative tool providing an analog reading   

Follow instructions included with either tool to obtain themeasurement.   

The correct DEF concentration is 31.8—33.2% urea. Ifthe DEF concentration is not within specification, drainthe DEF tank, flush with distilled water and fill with newor good DEF. If packaged DEF is not withinspecification, dispose of DEF packages and replacewith new or good DEF.   

DX,DEF,TEST-19-13JUN13   

## Storing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF)   

CAUTION: Avoid contact with eyes. In case ofcontact, immediately flush eyes with largeamounts of water for a minimum of 15 minutes.Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet(MSDS) for additional information.   

AdBlue is a trademark of VDA, the German Association of theAutomotive Industry.   

Fuels and Lubricants   

## 115-7   

Do not ingest DEF. In the event DEF is ingested,contact a physician immediately. Reference theMaterials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) foradditional information.   

IMPORTANT: It is unlawful to tamper with or removeany component of the aftertreatment system.Do not use DEF that does not meet the requiredspecifications or operate the engine with noDEF.   

Never attempt to create DEF by mixingagricultural grade urea with water. Agriculturalgrade urea does not meet the necessaryspecifications and can damage theaftertreatment system.   

Do not add any chemicals or additives to DEF inan effort to prevent freezing. Any chemicals oradditives added to DEF can damage theaftertreatment system.   

Never add water or any other fluid in place of, orin addition to DEF. Operating with a modifiedDEF or using an unapproved DEF can damagethe aftertreatment system.   

Storage information provided below is for reference andis to be used as a guideline only.   

It is preferred to store DEF out of extreme ambienttemperatures. DEF freezes at –11°C (12°F). Exposureto temperatures greater than 30°C (86°F) can degradeDEF over time. Do not store DEF in direct sunlight.   

Dedicated DEF storage containers must be sealedbetween uses to prevent evaporation andcontamination. Containers made of polyethylene,polypropylene, or stainless steel are recommended totransport and store DEF.   

Ideal conditions for storage of DEF are:   

●   

Store at temperatures between –5°C and 30°C (23°Fand 86°F)   

●   

Store in dedicated containers sealed to avoidcontamination and evaporation   

Under these conditions, DEF is expected to remainuseable for a minimum of 18 months. Storing DEF athigher temperatures can reduce its useful life byapproximately 6 months for every 5°C (9°F)temperature above 30°C (86°F).   

If unsure how long or under what conditions DEF hasbeen stored, test DEF. See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid(DEF).   

Long-term storage in the DEF tank (over 12 months) isnot recommended. If long-term storage is necessary,test DEF prior to operating engine. See Testing DieselExhaust Fluid (DEF).   

It is recommended to purchase DEF in quantities thatwill be consumed within 12 months.

TS1731—UN—23AUG13   

CAUTION: Avoid contact with eyes. In case ofcontact, immediately flush eyes with largeamounts of water for a minimum of 15 minutes.Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet(MSDS) for additional information.   

Do not ingest DEF. In the event DEF is ingested,contact a physician immediately. Reference theMaterials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) foradditional information.   

IMPORTANT: Use only distilled water to rinsecomponents that are used to deliver DEF. Tapwater can contaminate DEF. If distilled water isnot available, rinse with clean tap water, thenthoroughly rinse with ample amounts of DEF.   

If DEF is spilled or contacts any surface otherthan the storage tank, immediately clean thesurface with clear water. DEF is corrosive topainted and unpainted metallic surfaces andcan distort some plastic and rubbercomponents.   

If DEF is filled into engine fuel tank or otherfluid compartment, do not operate engine untilsystem is properly purged of DEF. Contact yourJohn Deere dealer immediately to determinehow to clean and purge the system.   

Reasonable care should be taken when refilling theDEF tank. Ensure that the DEF tank cap area is free ofdebris before removing the cap. Seal containers of DEFbetween use to prevent contamination and evaporation.   

Avoid splashing DEF and do not allow DEF to come intocontact with skin, eyes, or mouth.   

DEF is not harmful to handle, but DEF can be corrosiveto materials such as steel, iron, zinc, nickel, copper,aluminum, and magnesium. Use suitable containers totransport and store DEF. Containers made ofpolyethylene, polypropylene, or stainless steel arerecommended.

## Oil Filters   

Filtration of oils is critically important for properoperation and lubrication. John Deere brand oil filtershave been designed and produced specifically for JohnDeere applications.   

John Deere filters adhere to engineering specificationsfor quality of the filter media, filter efficiency rating,strength of the bond between the filter media and theelement end cap, fatigue life of the canister (ifapplicable), and pressure capability of the filter seal.Non-John Deere branded oil filters might not meet thesekey John Deere specifications.   

Always change oil filters regularly as specified in thismanual.   

DX,FILT1-19-11APR11   

## Fuel Filters   

The importance of fuel filtration cannot beoveremphasized with modern fuel systems. Thecombination of increasingly restrictive emissionregulations and more efficient engines requires fuelsystem to operate at much higher pressures. Higherpressures can only be achieved using fuel injectioncomponents with very close tolerances. These closemanufacturing tolerances have significantly reducedcapacities for debris and water.   

John Deere brand fuel filters have been designed andproduced specifically for John Deere engines.   

To protect the engine from debris and water, alwayschange engine fuel filters as specified in this manual.

## Lubricant Storage   

Your equipment can operate at top efficiency only whenclean lubricants are used.   

Use clean containers to handle all lubricants.   

Store lubricants and containers in an area protectedfrom dust, moisture, and other contamination. Storecontainers on their side to avoid water and dirtaccumulation.   

Make certain that all containers are properly marked toidentify their contents.   

Properly dispose of all old containers and any residuallubricant they may contain.   

DX,LUBST-19-11APR11   

## Mixing of Lubricants   

In general, avoid mixing different brands or types of oil.Oil manufacturers blend additives in their oils to meetcertain specifications and performance requirements.   

Mixing different oils can interfere with the properfunctioning of these additives and degrade lubricantperformance.

CAUTION: Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) containsurea. Do not get fluid in eyes. In case of contact,immediately flush eyes with large amounts ofwater for a minimum of 15 minutes. In the eventDEF is ingested, contact a physicianimmediately. Reference Materials Safety DataSheet (MSDS) for additional information.   

IMPORTANT: Using incorrect or unapprovedaftertreatment components can damage thevehicle’s aftertreatment system and reduceability of the aftertreatment system to functioncorrectly.   

NOTE: If DEF is spilled or contacts any surface otherthan the storage tank, immediately clean thesurface with clear water. DEF is corrosive topainted and unpainted metallic surfaces and candistort some plastic and rubber components.   

Cap (A) is not vented. Excess air is vented throughDiesel exhaust fluid (DEF) tank breather (B).   

Visually inspect the breather. Do not allow excessiveamounts of chaff or debris to collect on the breather. Ifthe breather is covered with debris, it does not allow thetank to breathe. Remove the breather from the hose andclean.   

Fill tank every time the machine is refueled. If thiscannot be done, monitor the Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF)level indicator on the corner post display and refill asnecessary. To avoid drastic changes in the machineperformance, always keep the fluid level above thetopmost red mark on the level indicator. See CombineOverview Application Help or Operator’s Station forfurther information.   

To fill tank:   

1.Wash and rinse containers with distilled water toremove contaminants before adding the fluid.   

2.Wipe area around the cap before removing to reducethe chance of contaminating fluid.

CAUTION: Shut OFF engine, set park brake, andremove key.   

IMPORTANT: Long-term storage of fluids in thevehicle (over 12 months) is not recommended.If long-term storage is necessary, periodictesting of the fluid is recommended to ensurethat the urea concentration does not fall out ofspecification.   

If an unapproved fluid, such as diesel fuel orengine coolant is added, drain the tank andrinse with distilled water, then refill the tank. Ifthe system does not operate correctly aftercleaning and refilling, contact your John Deeredealer to determine how to clean and purge thesystem. If water has been added to the tank,drain tank, flush with distilled water, and refillwith Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF). Check theconcentration of fluid after filling the tank. SeeFuels and Lubricants section for testing.   

NOTE: If DEF is spilled or contacts any surface otherthan the storage tank, immediately clean thesurface with clear water. Fluid is corrosive topainted surfaces and can distort some plastic andrubber components.   

1. Attach a hose to the fitting (A) at the bottom of thetank.   

2. Use handle (B) to open the drain valve.

Use a reliable brand of permanent-type ethylene glycol antifreeze which contains a rustinhibitor and water pump lubricant, but does not containa leak-stopping additive. See Fuels and Lubricants inthis manual for correct recommendations.   

After adding antifreeze, turn heater ON and run engineuntil it reaches operating temperature. This mixes thesolution and circulates it through the system.

A—Dust CoverB—Primary Air FilterC—Safety Filter   

IMPORTANT: When servicing the filters, shut OFFengine, set park brake, and remove key so dirtcannot be pulled into the engine.   

Service the filters only when the engine air filtericon is displayed on the armrest display.   

1. Unsnap dust cover (A) and remove the primary airfilter (B).   

2. Unscrew safety filter (C) in a counterclockwisedirection to remove. The safety filter stops dirt thatwould pass through a damaged primary filter.   

IMPORTANT: Never wash, brush, or knock theelements. If blowing out the primary element,use dry compressed air no greater than 500 kPa(5 bar) (72.5 psi). Clean the element from theinside out, making sure that the tip of the airgun does not come in contact with the filterpaper.   

Never clean the safety element. Replace if dirty.   

Never run the engine without both filters inplace.   

3. Service the filters as needed.   

4. Install the safety filter and turn in a clockwisedirection until hand-tight.   

5. Install the primary air filter and dust cover.   

6. Check all connections in the air intake system. Becertain that they are tight.   

IMPORTANT: Do not use any exhaust flow cleaningunit to blow chaff off the combine. Using such aunit can cause air filter failure, followed byengine failure.

## Diesel Particulate Filter AftertreatmentReplacement (Stage V)   

H127895—UN—24OCT19The exhaust filter includes the diesel oxidation catalystand diesel particulate filter (DPF). The DPF is designedto retain residual ash, which is a noncombustible resultof additives used in crankcase lubrication oils and thefuel. The DPF provides many hours of maintenance-freeoperation. At some point, the DPF requires professionalservice or replacement to remove the accumulated ash.The exact number of hours of operation before serviceor replacement is required varies depending upon theengine’s power category, duty cycle and operatingconditions, engine oil ash content, and fuel quality.Adhering to John Deere’s recommended oil and fuelspecifications will maximize the hours of operationbefore professional DPF service or replacement isrequired.   

As the engine owner, you are responsible for performingthe required maintenance described in your Operator’sManual. During normal equipment operation, the DPFmaintenance requirements will depend on the rate atwhich ash accumulates in it. DPFs on engines above175 hp/130 kW may require service or replacement atabout 4500 hours. As ash levels rise in the DPF, thecapacity for soot storage is reduced and the backpressure of the exhaust system will rise more frequently.A diagnostic trouble code will appear, indicating whenthe DPF needs servicing.   

The removal of DPF ash must be done by removing theDPF from the machine and placing it into specializedequipment. Do not remove ash by using water orchemicals. Removing ash by these methods maydamage the material securing the DPF in its canister,resulting in the loosening of the DPF element in thecanister and subjecting it to damage from vibration.   

Failure to follow the approved ash removal methodsmay violate U.S. federal, state, and local hazardouswaste laws, and may also damage the DPF, resulting inpotential denial of the diesel exhaust filter emissionswarranty. It is strongly recommended you take the DPFto an authorized John Deere service location or otherqualified service provider for service or replacement.   

When AUTO or PARKED cleaning is enabled, theexhaust temperature may be high under no load or light

## Exhaust Filter / Diesel Particulate Filter AshHandling and Disposal (Stage V)   

CAUTION: Under federal, state, and/or locallaws or regulations, diesel particulate filter(DPF) ash may be classified as a hazardouswaste. Hazardous waste must be disposed of inaccordance with all applicable federal, state,and local laws or regulations governinghazardous waste disposal. Only a qualifiedservice provider should remove ash from theDPF. Personal protective equipment andclothing, maintained in a sanitary and reliablecondition, should be used when handling andcleaning a DPF. See your John Deere dealer orqualified service provider for assistance.

Troubleshooting   

## 125-22   

## Preparing Machine for Storage   

Swing out condenser and oil cooler and clean radiatorwith air, water, or a vacuum cleaner.   

Clean condenser and oil cooler after cleaning radiator.Clean charge air cooler.   

Every 60—90 days, start engine and turn airconditioning ON. Run engine at low idle for severalminutes for compressor seal lubrication. Outsidetemperature should be above 5°C (40°F) for proper airconditioning operation.   

Clean the surfaces of the engine with a safe solvent.   

CAUTION: Do not use gasoline for cleaning.   

Clean inside the air cleaner and install new elements.   

Drain the engine crankcase while the engine is warm.Replace filter and fill with correct oil. Add 0.66 L (22 oz)of a corrosion inhibitor to the engine crankcase. Runengine to circulate.   

Drain, flush, and refill cooling system with 50/50 mixtureof antifreeze and water.   

IMPORTANT: Long-term storage in vehicle (over 12months) is not recommended. If long-termstorage is necessary, periodic testing of dieselexhaust fluid (DEF) is recommended to ensurethat urea concentration does not fall out ofspecification.   

Final Tier 4/Stage V: Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) has alimited shelf life, but it may be stored in the vehicle for aslong as 12 months, depending upon storage conditions.See Storing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) and RefillingDiesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank in Fuels andLubricants section for further information. See DieselExhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank—Filling and Diesel ExhaustFluid (DEF) Tank—Draining in Maintenance—AsRequired (Engine Fluids and Filters) section for furtherinformation.   

IMPORTANT: Final Tier 4/Stage V: Do not disconnectbattery for at least 90 seconds after machine isshut OFF. Selective catalyst reduction (SCR)system automatically purges lines of dieselexhaust fluid (DEF) during this time,immediately after machine is shut OFF. Ifadequate time is not allowed for lines to bepurged, any fluid remaining in lines cancrystallize and plug lines. Fluid freezes andpossibly burst lines in freezing weatherconditions.   

NOTE: Turn battery disconnect switch OFF if machine isstored longer than 25 days. If storage period islonger than 90 days, remove negative lead tobatteries to minimize load to batteries.   

Charge batteries completely. Specific gravity equals   

1.260 volts. To minimize load to the batteries, removethe negative lead to the batteries.   

Drain water separator.   

Clean machine inside and out. Leave elevator doorsand drain covers open.   

Cycle concave up and down several times to preventmaterial buildup in the concave area.   

IMPORTANT: Directing pressurized water atelectronic/electrical components orconnectors, bearings and hydraulic seals, fuelinjection pumps, or other sensitive parts andcomponents may cause product malfunctions.Reduce pressure, and spray at a 45° to 90°angle.   

Repaint areas where needed.   

NOTE: It is not necessary to wax the machine.However, if desired, use a good clear wax thatcontains no abrasives. These types of waxesusually do not contain cleaners.   

Lubricate machine and grease adjusting bolt threads.   

Perform all 400 hours (yearly) services.   

To prevent condensation, fill fuel tank.   

IMPORTANT: To stabilize the fuel and prevent watercondensation, add fuel conditioner when thefollowing occurs:   

●   

Fuel is stored in the fuel tanks (machine orfarm storage) for extended periods of time.See your John Deere dealer forrecommendations.   

●   

A slow turnover of fuel is being used. Seeyour John Deere dealer forrecommendations.   

For prolonged machine storage, the bestpractice is to drain biodiesel and fill machinewith regular petroleum diesel fuel. Otherwise,use biodiesel stabilizer (anti-oxidant) additivesor fully formulated biodiesel conditioners. Seeyour John Deere dealer for recommendations.   

If machine is to be stored for a long period, remove andclean the batteries. Store them in a cool, dry place andkeep them fully charged.   

Before storing the machine, the air compressorreservoir (if equipped) MUST be drained of water.   

It is recommended to lower the feeder house roughly 50mm (2 in) before shutting the machine off for long termstorage or service.

## Storage   

## 130-1   

## Removing Machine from Storage   

Reconnect and/or charge batteries.   

Charge batteries completely. Specific gravity equals1.260 volts. To minimize load to the batteries, removenegative lead to the batteries.   

Check oil and coolant levels. Inspect for leaks and addoil and coolant if needed.   

Final Tier 4/Stage V: If diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) tankwas not drained, test urea concentration. See TestingDiesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) in Fuels and Lubricantssection for further information. If concentration is notwithin specifications, drain and replace with new dieselexhaust fluid (DEF). If diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) tankwas drained, fill tank. See Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF)Tank—Filling in Maintenance—As Required (EngineFluids and Filters) section for further information.

Close elevator doors and drain hole.   

Check tension of drive belts. Adjust spring-loaded idlersuntil the washer is positioned between the end of thegauge and the bottom of the step.   

Check tire inflation and review machine Operator'sManual.   

Inspect fire extinguishers (front and left-hand side) byfollowing maintenance instructions on the fireextinguisher label. Recharge or replace as necessary.

CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS CONTROL WARRANTY STATEMENT:   

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is pleased to explain the emission-control system warranty on 2019 through 2021 off-road diesel   

engines. In California, new off-road engines must be designed, built and equipped to meet the State’s stringent anti-smog standards. John Deere   

must warrant the emission control system on your engine for the periods of time listed below provided there has been no abuse, neglect or   

improper maintenance of your engine.   

Your emission control system may include parts such as the fuel injection system and the air induction system. Also included may be hoses, belts,   

connectors and other emission-related assemblies.   

John Deere warrants to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that this off-road diesel engine was designed, built, and equipped   

so as to conform at the time of sale with all applicable regulations adopted by CARB and is free from defects in materials and workmanship which   

would cause the failure of a warranted part to be identical in all material respects to the part as described in John Deere's application for   

certification for a period of five years from the date the engine is delivered to an ultimate purchaser or 3,000 hours of operation, whichever occurs   

first for all engines rated at 19 kW and greater. In the absence of a device to measure hours of use, the engine shall be warranted for a period of   

five years.   

EMISSIONS WARRANTY EXCLUSIONS:   

John Deere may deny warranty claims for failures caused by the use of an add-on or modified part which has not been exempted by the CARB. A   

modified part is an aftermarket part intended to replace an original emission-related part which is not functionally identical in all respects and which   

in any way affects emissions. An add-on part is any aftermarket part which is not a modified part or a replacement part.
