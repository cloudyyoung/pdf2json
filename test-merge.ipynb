      "The Feekes and Zadoks scales define the growth stages of a relatively uniform cereal crop. Completion of these growth stages by the cereal crop will be influenced greatly by soil temperature, moisture, air temperature and day length. For example, stages 2 to 5 in the Feekes scale may take 5 to 6 weeks, whereas stages 6 to 10 may be completed in 2 to 3 weeks under prairie conditions.To establish the growth stage of a cereal crop using either of these scales, it is necessary to collect a random sample of plants to determine the level of growth attained by the majority of the plants.Under good growing conditions, examination of up to 10 randomly selected plants may be appropriate. Under conditions of uneven germination and low soil moisture, growth stage assessment may require larger samples.Application of an agrochemical must be timed precisely to maximize the desired effect on the target crop. All agrochemical applications (fungicides, growth regulators, herbicides or supplemental nutrients) must be based on physiological growth stage of the crop. Applications based on calendar  days are less accurate and will be less successful. invalid chars\n",

      "There are several reasons why a nozzle may not produce its advertised nominal flow rate. These include plugging of the nozzle, nozzle screen or another component of the nozzle body, obstructed boom section or main screen, nozzle wear and physical damage. Confirming the actual flow rate of the nozzles is an important part of good spray practice.1. Ensure sprayer is clean and contains sufficient water for calibration.2. Install accurate pressure gauge on boom. A threaded nozzle cap will fit a standard gauge thread. The nozzle cap can then be installed in place of a nozzle. 3. Operate all boom sections and set boom pressure to 40 psi.4. Collect spray from each nozzle for a consistent length of time. Depending on the capacity of the vessel, this may be, for example, 30 seconds. 5. Measure and record volume from each nozzle.6. Calculate average flow rate per minute and compare to nominal flow for that size nozzle (see nozzle chart in this publication).7. If overall average flow rate is significantly greater than the nominal flow for that nozzle, the set is worn and should be replaced.8. If flow deviation is associated with a boom section, confirm spray pressure at that section and correct any flow obstructions.9. If average flow rate is within specifications, identify individual nozzles whose output deviates by more than 5% from the average. Correct by cleaning or replacing.Nozzle calibration tools are available from certain suppliers. These calculate flow rate electronically, and may store the flow values for analysis.Nozzle calibration cannot be done with the sprayer’s flow meter or by measuring tank contents. Such approaches measure total flow and will not detect problems with individual nozzles or boom sections. invalid chars\n",

The colours and flow numbers are shown in the nozzle chart on page 646.For field sprayers, the fan angle has a value between 65 and 150, with 80 and 110 being most common. For any given nozzle, wider fan angles produce finer sprays and allow lower boom heights. Flow rate units on all nozzles are US gallons of water per minute (gpm) at 40 psi. An 04 nozzle will be red in colour and deliver 0.4 gpm at 40 psi.

EC values less than 500 µS/cm are considered safe. For values above 500, a hardness test is necessary to confirm the presence of antagonizing cations.

Spray grade liquid concentrate AMS product is available from some suppliers. The sulphate anions tie up the hard water cations, preventing them from antagonizing the herbicide. Liquid urea-ammonium nitrate (28-0-0) has also been shown to help with hard water, although it is not as effective as AMS.Caution is advised when adding foliar fertilizer specialty products to pesticide mixtures. Adding a blend of fertilizer salts, combined with associated changes in pH, can result in unpredictable interactions with pesticides and water. Ask for compatibility data and always conduct a jar test to be sure that the planned mixture does not result in a precipitate that can plug spray nozzles or make the pesticide inactive.Turbidity is a problem with surface waters, especially in areas of clay soils and after surface runoff. If spray water is taken from a pond, its turbidity can be reduced by adding aluminum sulphate at rates between 10 and 60 mg/L of pond water. Thorough agitation is required, and 80 to 95% removal of turbidity is achieved within 24 to 48 hours. invalid chars\n",

      "Labels differ on their cleanout requirements. When in doubt, use the following general procedure.1. Carefully measure the volume requirements of the last tank before a change of products is planned. Accurate filling will help minimize leftovers. 2. When a field has been sprayed, dispose of the tank remainders by spraying them out in the field or another designated site. Do not drain tank contents on the ground.3. Use a clean water tank to introduce clean water into the sprayer tank via wash-down nozzles. Multiple batches of smaller volumes are more efficient at diluting remainders than a single larger volume. Run solution pump long enough to ensure that all plumbing, including agitation and sparge, has been exposed to clean water. Spray this volume out in the field until the tank is empty. When spraying out, make sure to rinse through any bypass valves. Repeat at least 2 more times. See Table 1 to evaluate efficiency of diluting spray mix remainders. Note the effect of smaller remainder volumes and more batches of smaller volumes on overall remainder dilution. 4. Some products specify the use of ammonia, surfactant or specific commercial products during cleanout. a. Ammonia acts to raise solution pH, which aids in cleaning products whose solubility improves with higher pH. These include all Group 2 products except those in the imidazolinone group. See “Herbicide group classification by mode of action” section for specific product names.b. Surfactants help solubilize oily products  such as EC formulations. Oily layers may trap Group 2 products to which canola can be very sensitive.c. Commercial products contain proprietary components that aid in cleaning pesticide products from sprayer components.5.

      "Pesticide drift is a concern for ground as well as aerial application. Landowners are responsible for ensuring that any pesticide applications conducted on their property are conducted in a safe, responsible manner.The choice of chemical should be made with adjacent land uses in mind. If neighbours have livestock, bees, shelterbelts and gardens that may be affected by off-target drift, they should be notified prior to application. Perhaps a different chemical, formulation or application method will provide the same control and greater compatibility with neighbouring land uses.Always assess the risk to adjacent landowners and never push weather conditions to meet deadlines. If completing an application as planned may mean damaging your neighbour’s property, postpone the application or modify it to prevent off-target damage. Landowners can be held liable for pesticide drift even if a custom applicator was hired to perform the application. When hiring a custom applicator the company should be registered, employ certified professionals and possess the knowledge, equipment and expertise to perform the work properly. Custom applicators must be aware of neighbouring residences and sensitive crops (including gardens, livestock, bees, shelterbelts and gardens) that could present problems if drift should occur.All pesticide users, commercial pesticide applicators and farmers are legally responsible for safe pesticide use. Farmers who cause damage with their pesticide application activities or who counsel a commercial pesticide service to conduct either an illegal pesticide application or an application under questionable circumstances (e.g., extremely windy conditions) that results in damage, can be held liable for compensation and face potential prosecution. Farmers are cautioned not to counsel commercial applicators to apply pesticides not registered for the use intended or to direct applications to occur under known circumstances that could cause damage (such as under windy conditions). Should such actions result in charges being laid, this may subsequently cost the farmer time in court and payment for the remediation of damaged crops, shelterbelts, gardens, etc. Buffer strips should be left when applying pesticides next to sensitive crops, watersheds and farmsteads. The size of these strips may be specified on the pesticide label, but if not, the size will depend on the chemical used, the application method and the degree of risk from escaping drift. Pesticide applications conducted near rivers, creeks, lakes, irrigation canals or other open bodies of water require extra care and caution to ensure water users will not be affected by the proposed pesticide application and that the application is conducted in a manner that will not adversely affect aquatic or riparian habitats. Ideally, natural vegetation should be left along natural water bodies to ensure bank stability and to provide a natural buffer and filter for agricultural chemicals. A Special Use Approval must be obtained from Alberta Environment to perform pesticide applications within 30 metres of an open body of water when the adjacent land is unimproved rangeland, pasture or woodlot. Certified applicators applying pesticides within 30 metres of an open body of water do not require a Special Use Approval as long as the pesticide they are using is identified in the Environmental Code of Practice for pesticides and they are following the conditions of application specified in the code. invalid chars\n",

      "Spray quality, boom height and travel speed are the main factors under operator control. Follow these guidelines to manage drift damage.1. Survey the area surrounding the field and identify sensitive areas. Consider waiting until wind direction is most favourable.2. Maintain low boom heights. Adequate overlap of 80-degree nozzles can be achieved at a 20-inch boom height. 110-degree nozzles can be operated as low as 15 inches above target. Conduct visual assessment to ensure that the spray patterns produce at minimum a double overlap. This means the edges of the spray pattern should reach the adjacent nozzle locations. invalid chars\n",

      "3. Choose products that have lower buffer zones or are compatible with coarser sprays. Spray the coarsest spray quality that will provide adequate coverage for the product and pest. In most cases, an ASABE coarse spray is fine enough for good coverage at water volumes recommended on the pesticide label. Even coarser sprays can be used for systemic products and broadleaf weeds.4. Formulation type can affect the droplet size produced by spray tips. Water-soluble solution (S) formulations typically produce finer sprays, whereas oily EC formulations suppress the production of fines. Some adjuvants can help reduce spray drift although spray pressure and nozzle selection will have a larger impact. Such adjuvants are useful when the pesticide effectiveness may be reduced with a spray quality that is too coarse.5. Slower travel speeds allow the spray to move towards the target more quickly. Greater speeds create a larger airborne spray plume that may be displaced behind the sprayer. Slower speeds also allow for more consistent boom heights.6. Higher water volumes require larger nozzles that typically produce coarser sprays. More water provides an opportunity for coarser sprays without sacrificing coverage.7. Spray perpendicular to the wind, starting at the downwind side of the field. Spray headlands at lower spray pressures to increase droplet size. Additionally, spray such headlands on the downwind edge of the field so the remainder of the field can be sprayed at more normal pressures. invalid chars\n",

      "Sprayer adjustments alone don’t guarantee product performance or protect from spray drift. The following actions contribute to better applications.1. Use forecasting services with good wind speed and direction capabilities to assist in planning an operation. 2. Use the directional consistency of wind as a planning tool.3. Measure wind speed locally using a weather station or hand-held device. Official wind speeds are reported at a height of 10 metres where wind speed is usually greater than it is closer to the ground where drift is generated.4. Spray on sunny days if possible. Solar heating creates thermal turbulence that helps disperse any spray drift.5. Do not spray between dusk and dawn if skies are clear and winds are low. These times coincide with formation of temperature inversions that prevent spray dispersion and can cause long-distance transport of the spray cloud.6. Extremes of air humidity during windy conditions can increase spray drift problems. Low humidity increases evaporation rates that reduce droplet size and increasing drift potential before deposition. When using fine sprays, high humidity can extend the life of smaller droplets, prolonging the damage that drifting droplets cause.7. High temperatures increase the vapour loss of volatile products. Volatile products should not be sprayed during, or prior to, high air temperatures.  invalid chars\n",

      "The Alberta Environmentally Sustainable Agriculture (AESA) Stream Survey was initiated in 1999 and continued until 2006. It tested the water quality in  23 watersheds throughout the agricultural areas of the province several times each year. This produced information on the presence and distribution of 68 possible pesticide residues in the water. 4 of the watersheds received irrigation return flows and the rest were dryland. Pesticide residues were commonly found in survey water samples. Keep in mind that testing processes are able to detect very small amounts of chemical, far below any observable effect. Maximum pesticide concentrations were typically found in spring and  also coincided with summer pesticide application. Concentrations of detected pesticides occasionally exceeded existing water quality guidelines for either the protection of aquatic life or irrigation use.  This study highlights the importance of using due care and attention when applying pesticides as they do not necessarily remain where they are applied.

      "Triple rinsing or pressure rinsing of pesticide containers is the recommended method of cleaning them prior to disposal. Triple rinsing renders used pesticide containers (metal, plastic, glass) more than 99% free (less than 1 ppm) of residues in most cases. There are a number of systems for pressure rinsing. The simpler style consists of a hollow spike connected to a water line, which injects water under pressure into the jug, which is then drained into the spray tank. A newer style consists of a small hopper mounted on the sprayer with a sharp metal jug opener and a pressure rinse nozzle in the bottom of the hopper. The full jug is inserted on the jug opener, which drains the chemical into the tank. Wash water is injected under pressure to rinse the container. The chemical and rinse solution is then pumped into the spray tank by direct hose connections.Unrinsed containers have the potential to contaminate soil, ground water and surface water, and can be toxic to fish and wildlife. Unrinsed containers impede the processing and recycling of empty pesticide containers, as containers must be emptied, and workers are exposed to the residue. Residues can be transported to the atmosphere during storage, processing, shipping and energy recovery, or they can contaminate end products from plastic recycling processes. In addition,  it is estimated that 6 to 7% of product can be left in unrinsed containers. This amount of material  can treat between 1/2 and 1 acre of land and result in the saving of several dollars.It is the responsibility of the farming community to ensure their empty pesticide containers are directed to a designated collection site, whether it is a municipal site or back to the point of purchase (depending on the product and size of container). Determine the correct disposal site at the time of purchase.Containers disposed of at a container collection site are to be clean (triple rinsed or pressured rinsed)  and well drained (dry). Paper bags and cardboard containers that contained pesticides should be thoroughly emptied and disposed of at a sanitary landfill.  invalid chars\n",

      "The best way to minimize the effects of a pesticide spill is to have an emergency response plan prepared and in place. This should include a copy of the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) and an established procedure to handle all types of pesticide emergency. In addition, a spill cleanup kit should be prepared and be available near the pesticide storage site and at the mixing and loading site. A spill cleanup kit should include the following:• personal protective equipment (see the Protective Clothing and Equipment section)• absorbent material such as activated charcoal, vermiculite, dry coarse clay, kitty litter or commercial absorbent. Contaminated absorbents can be disposed at a sanitary landfill• neutralizing material as indicated on the SDS• long-handled broom for dry formulations• shovel for liquid formulations• waste-receiving container with a lid• blank labels to identify contents of waste containerIn the event of a pesticide spill, follow these steps.• Isolate affected area.• Put on protective clothing and equipment.• Ventilate the area (if indoors). For outdoor spills, work from the upwind side of the spill.• If possible, stop the containers from further leaking.• Contain the spread of the spill using soil, sand bags, vermiculite, kitty litter, etc. to provide a barrier to the spread of the spill. Prevent pesticide entry into sewers or water supply.• Report the spill immediately (if into or threatening a watercourse or if the pesticide is or will cause an adverse effect off your property).• Clean up the spilled pesticide. Absorb spill on paper, sand, dirt or other inert material (e.g., kitty litter). Contaminated absorbents can be disposed at a sanitary landfill.• Decontaminate the spill area by washing the site with detergent or other cleaning products such as ammonia. Check the product label SDS (safety data sheets) or contact the manufacturer for advice on cleanup procedures (most products have a 1-800 customer service number on the label) and disposal. If the spill is large, evacuate the area and notify safety personnel.Emergencies or spills must be reported to the  24-hour Alberta Environmental Response Centre:  1-800-222-6514.The CleanFarms initiative offers a free empty pesticide container recycling program. The program requires pesticide containers to be pressure rinsed or triple rinsed.

      "Traditionally, pesticides have been registered for use on crops grown to maturity. Grazing or cutting of the immature crop for hay was not considered as the intended use, so residue information on the immature plant was not requested in the registration process.  A grazing or haying interval is considered in the registration process only if the green matter is to be fed to livestock. Consequently, many pesticide labels have no statement as to whether or not it is safe to graze the crop(s) listed prior to maturity. The absence of this information may lead farmers to assume  that since there is no specific warning with respect  to grazing, it is safe to do so.Present pesticide labelling policy is meant to define only the acceptable uses of the product. It does not list or take into account the “don’ts.” Therefore, it cannot be assumed that if something is not stated on the label, it is accepted for use. A new accepted use can only be made through the submission of relevant data to support that use.In light of the above, pesticide labels that are silent  on grazing will carry the following statement: “Don’t graze the treated crops or cut for hay; there is not sufficient data available to support such use.” invalid chars\n",

Crops most tolerant after corn and triazine-tolerant canola are sorghum, then flax, faba bean and peas. The risk of damage to succeeding crops from atrazine residues may be reduced by ploughing or deep tilling treated fields in the fall prior to seeding the next crop in the rotation. Spreading and incorporating manure may also help to reduce the atrazine levels. Uneven application, excessive sprayer overlap or applications in excess of recommended rates will not injure corn but may result in a longer carryover of atrazine residues.

For faster burndown of coniferous species, use a recommended surfactant with Grazon XC at 0.25% or up to 0.375% v/v for maximum rainfastness.

Susceptible weeds develop injury symptoms within hours of application under active growing conditions; plant death occurs within 3 to 5 days depending on growing conditions.

Use certified seed and good agronomic practices to reduce the effect on rotational crops.Inferno Duo is degraded by soil microbes; environmental conditions that decrease microbial activity must be considered when making rotational cropping decisions. These environmental conditions include prolonged drought and/or cold temperatures within the following cropping season, as well as soils with both low organic matter (less than 2%) and high pH (greater than 7.5). If these conditions exist, a soil bioassay may be necessary to ensure rotational crop safety.  invalid chars\n",

      "Pixxaro is a systemic herbicide that moves within the plant for control of exposed and underground plant tissues. The product controls weeds by disrupting normal plant growth patterns. Symptoms of weeds include epinasty (twisting of the stems) and swollen nodes.

Weeds hardened off by cold weather or drought stress may not be adequately controlled or suppressed and re-growth may occur. invalid chars\n",

Initial crop injury may occur in the form of crop shortening or discolouration and is more likely when fenoxaprop is applied alone and not tank mixed or is applied past the recommended leaf stage or under stressful growing conditions. Barley tends to be more susceptible to this injury than wheat. This condition is temporary and should not affect yield.Under stressed conditions and/or heavy crop canopy, early application will result in improved grassy weed control.

Since UpBeet has little or no soil activity, only weeds that have emerged above the soil surface will be controlled. Use sequential tank mix applications to control new weed flushes. Timely cultivation(s) can be used in addition to UpBeet tank mixes for optimum weed control in a sugar beet management program. Dry, dusty field conditions may reduce weed control in wheel track areas. Higher water volumes may improve control in these conditions. invalid chars\n",

Insecticides will kill the pest insect if applied properly at a stage when the pest is susceptible. An application made too early or too late in the life cycle may not provide adequate control.

      "Seed treatment provides economical insurance against many diseases and some insect pests of seed and seedlings. Chemical treatment can give seedlings a head start by preventing or reducing damage resulting from certain crop pests.Diseases are controlled by contact fungicides that destroy fungi carried on the seed, such as common bunt of wheat, the surface-borne smuts of barley  and oats, fungus stripe of barley and some leaf-spotting and seed decay fungi. Systemic fungicides destroy fungi carried in the seed, such as loose smut of wheat and barley, and they protect the early growth of the seedling.Specific recommendations:• Rye and flax should be treated because they are very susceptible to seed decay.• Winter wheat should be treated to prevent bunt and seed decay as well as to promote good seedling growth.• If bunt or smut was observed in a crop that will  be used for seed, the grain should be treated. If a variety is grown that is susceptible to bunt or smut and the presence of the disease is uncertain, it may be wise to treat the seed annually or every second year, depending on the susceptibility of the variety.• Canola should always be treated to control the seed-borne phase of blackleg.• Alfalfa seed is treated to control verticillium wilt.Insecticidal seed treatment will prevent or reduce damage caused by certain crop pests. invalid chars\n",

      "Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are synthetic compounds that can beneficially modify plant growth and development. These compounds function by altering hormonal activity to produce shorter stems, reduce lodging and maintain grain yield. PGRs are a tool that can help mitigate lodging pressure and are most useful in environments with abundant moisture and high levels of fertility.Research is ongoing to address many questions about PGRs. It is known that effective PGR applications require careful crop staging, but their use is not recommended under stressful environmental conditions, and responses are species and cultivar specific. However, PGRs can be a risk management tool to reduce lodging and yield losses commonly found in intensive management systems. invalid chars\n",

      "Cereal species and cereal varieties differ in their sensitivity to PGRs. Wheat is generally most responsive and barley is less responsive when height reductions are used as a measure of efficacy. Significant differences in lodging response to PGR applications have been reported, depending on the cultivar. Not all cultivars respond equally well to PGRs, and the height or lodging rating of a cultivar is not a reliable indicator of PGR effectiveness.PGRs can have inconsistent responses between years, sites, cultivars and species. Alberta research suggests that 93% of the time, PGRs will cause significant wheat height reductions (between 3 and 13 cm) compared to no PGR application. However, there are occasional instances when some cultivars show no height reduction in response to PGR application. invalid chars\n",

      "PGRs are applied to the crop foliage and change plant physiology by reducing cell elongation, reducing stem length, shortening the uppermost internodes and peduncle. They may also alter stem diameter. However, plant hormones act in concert. The level of one hormone affects other hormones, so PGRs may have secondary effects, such as delayed senescence, increased resistance to environmental stress or shifting assimilates to the roots resulting in increased root growth. PGRs can positively or negatively affect yield, but results are inconsistent depending on crop lodging, environmental conditions, crop species and cultivar. PGRs are systemic but non-residual, which can result in undesirable side effects such as stem elongation in some cultivars and temporary, short-term height reduction. PGRs can also alter tiller growth. PGR applications are frequently associated with significant increases in crop greenness, delayed maturity (up to three days) and decreased thousand kernel weight. Farmers must weigh the benefits of PGRs against the chance of extended days to maturity, reduced test weight and the possibility of reduced protein content when deciding to use a PGR. invalid chars\n",
